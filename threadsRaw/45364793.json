The air shimmers with oppressive heat. You wonder how that Excavator thing is going along\u0026mdash;if it\u0026rsquo;s going along at all. You wonder if they\u0026rsquo;re going to make it fireproof.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nYou stop a few times for Cardus to check the terrain adjacent for minerals, managing to collect meager amounts of iron ore and ruby gems, which the four of you are quite thankful to see. You suppose if anything, you won\u0026rsquo;t be leaving empty handed.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nEventually, you find yourself on a high set of natural bridges overlooking the magma chamber. Far ahead, you can see a rocky plateau where numerous crystal outcroppings\u0026mdash;fiery red\u0026mdash;look available to be mined. Far off to one side, an opening reminiscent of a doorway leads into a large, open-looking chamber, with lava pouring down along the outer walls into the abyss below, like a sort of decoration. A party of five, a few Nameless among them, appear to be leaving the area. It sounds like they\u0026rsquo;re celebrating, but they\u0026rsquo;re looking a bit scuffed up.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022greentext\u0022\u003E\u0026gt; Investigate the open chamber.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022greentext\u0022\u003E\u0026gt; Head out onto the crystal plateau.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022greentext\u0022\u003E\u0026gt; Write-in.\u003C\/span\u003E","formatted":false,"title_processed":null,"name_processed":"Sylvetica","email_processed":null,"trip_processed":"!3c0YaXQPuY","poster_hash_processed":null,"poster_country_name":false,"poster_country_name_processed":"","extra_data":[],"exif":null,"media":{"media_id":"8746015","spoiler":"0","preview_orig":"1455256768325s.jpg","media":"1455256768325.jpg","preview_op":null,"preview_reply":"1455256768325s.jpg","preview_w":"125","preview_h":"57","media_filename":"lava_by_zhangc-d5a5d5h.jpg","media_w":"1200","media_h":"551","media_size":"275075","media_hash":"RPZ1RvXRRL1UNtuH5G45ew==","media_orig":"1455256768325.jpg","exif":null,"total":"5","banned":"0","media_status":"normal","safe_media_hash":"RPZ1RvXRRL1UNtuH5G45ew","remote_media_link":null,"media_link":"https:\/\/s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz\/tg\/image\/1455\/25\/1455256768325.jpg","thumb_link":"https:\/\/s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz\/tg\/thumb\/1455\/25\/1455256768325s.jpg","media_filename_processed":"lava_by_zhangc-d5a5d5h.jpg"},"board":{"name":"Traditional Games","shortname":"tg"}},"45371480":{"doc_id":"24255698","num":"45371480","subnum":"0","thread_num":"45364793","op":"0","timestamp":1455256848,"timestamp_expired":"0","capcode":"N","email":null,"name":"Anonymous","trip":null,"title":null,"comment":"\u003E\u003E45371454\n\u003E\u003E Head out onto the crystal plateau.\nMark it on our map for further investigation with a full party.","poster_hash":null,"poster_country":null,"sticky":"0","locked":"0","deleted":"0","nreplies":null,"nimages":null,"fourchan_date":"2\/12\/16(Fri)1:00","comment_sanitized":"\u003E\u003E45371454\n\u003E\u003E Head out onto the crystal plateau.\nMark it on our map for further investigation with a full party.","comment_processed":"\u003Cspan class=\u0022greentext\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/desuarchive.org\/tg\/thread\/45364793\/#45371454\u0022 class=\u0022backlink\u0022 data-function=\u0022highlight\u0022 data-backlink=\u0022true\u0022 data-board=\u0022tg\u0022 data-post=\u002245371454\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;45371454\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022greentext\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Head out onto the crystal plateau.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nMark it on our map for further investigation with a full party.","formatted":false,"title_processed":null,"name_processed":"Anonymous","email_processed":null,"trip_processed":null,"poster_hash_processed":null,"poster_country_name":false,"poster_country_name_processed":"","extra_data":[],"exif":null,"media":null,"board":{"name":"Traditional Games","shortname":"tg"}},"45371536":{"doc_id":"24255757","num":"45371536","subnum":"0","thread_num":"45364793","op":"0","timestamp":1455257124,"timestamp_expired":"0","capcode":"N","email":null,"name":"Anonymous","trip":null,"title":null,"comment":"\u003E\u003E45371454\n\u003E Head out onto the crystal plateau.\n\u003E\u003E45371480\nIs four people not enough for you?
