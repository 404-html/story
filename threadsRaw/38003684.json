There\u0027s what looks like a skirmish underway up ahead, with the ranks of the Averron Guard broken by a group of Nameless. Three guardsmen stand a ways apart from one another, looking for an approach angle on the group of four Nameless they\u0027re surrounding.\n\nThe Nameless, though, are set on other targets. They\u0027re engaged in combat with an absolutely massive, greataxe-wielding man--you think he maxed his avatar\u0027s dimensions--wearing red-trimmed armor, marked with a familiar logo. Crimson Guard. They\u0027re lashing in and out like the sisters with chromatic hair you fought earlier, taking turns to keep the adjacent guardsmen at bay.\n\nThey\u0027re chipping away at the Crimson\u0027s armor. It seems like they\u0027re too fast for him; then, he twirls his axe overhead and levels it in a wide, barreling maneuver that cleaves through a member of the Nameless group, shoulder to waist. He spins, spiked shield ready, and takes a hit to the back that doesn\u0027t seem to bother him. Rather than block the next attack, he bashes the next Nameless with his shield, immobilizing him for long enough for the Crimson to essentially fall on him, shield forward, planting the spike through his chest.\n\nHe rolls aside to dodge a blow from behind, and the members of the Guard move in to finish off the third kill before helping the Crimson to his feet. The four of them begin to make their way into the city, with you following cautiously a ways behind them.
