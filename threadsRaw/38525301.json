The threads here don\u0027t last too long; you\u0027re not sure if they\u0027re getting cleaned up, or the board is actually moving at lightning speed. Why is this game pay-to-play? What do you mean\u0026mdash;it\u0027s free. Can you upgrade your account if you die? Does it actually hurt when you get attacked? I got killed: how do I get my UI back? This is wrong, the Celestial Gems are doing something to us. Shut up, you stupid fuck, it\u0027s just part of the game. Does time move slower in Broken Sky? That can\u0027t be good for your health. But that\u0027s not possible. How can the game interpret a prayer for a Celestial Artifact? Has anyone been to the fortune teller? The things he says are just completely random.
