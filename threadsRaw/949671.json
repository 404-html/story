Gazing down the sights, you look deep into the chasm. Paths wind down, with tunnels beneath \u2013 caves, leading into small unseen areas carved out of the rock.\n\nIn the center of it all, white light pours from an enormous, chiseled icon. It is as a sigil, or some unknown message of the Earthsea, though it appears damaged in a way that leaves you unsure whether mere magic will be able to fix it. Strewn about nearby, you can see bodies, broken Identifiers \u2013 fallen Players, no doubt.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t lying. This is the place.\n\nYou watch the sigil for a little bit. Runes surrounding the outside gradually fill with light, as if they are counting up to something; your impression of it given about twenty seconds of analysis is that there\u2019s twelve of them in total with ten currently to go, and it takes about sixty seconds for one to fill completely.\n\nAs you think on your Artifact, a haunting image passes through your mind: the face of Velika, whom you had only recently allowed yourself to forget. A clawed finger reaches out to touch your chest, carving a line down your breastbone. Your flesh parts, giving way not to blood, but to a sheet of cold, unyielding porcelain, clean and immaculate white. Tendrils of ivory creep across your skin from the seam to entomb your invulnerable body beneath, forever locking your features in place.\n\n\u003E With the Memory of Marble, gain a massive increase in damage resistance and health regeneration for a short duration.\n\u003E Additionally, deal bonus unarmed damage at the cost of a significant reduction in manual dexterity.\n\u003E Strife Memoriam remains inactive for a short time after reallocating equipped Memories.\n\nYou take a sharp breath, snapping back suddenly to consciousness; you stand ready, looking like a cloaked gunman briefly as you hold Rubi at the ready, finger running parallel to the trigger guard. It\u2019d probably be best to put this thing away before you shoot your eye out.
