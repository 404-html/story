Her voice sounds a little off, and you realize how bad that burn is; you can see teeth through the left side of her face. Otherwise intact, though. You wonder how much HP she\u0027s lost. Eunoia perches on her shoulder, and she begins applying bandages.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u0026ldquo;That didn\u0027t hurt, did it?\u0026rdquo; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0027t hurt.\u0026rdquo; She snaps. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, then.\u0026rdquo; You say. \u0026ldquo;Tatsumaki, are you alright with that?\u0026rdquo;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nShe nods, and presents her gauntleted hand, stirring the haze rising off of it with her other index finger.

The cavern is dark, and appears to spiral a short ways downward. You hear faint snoring when you stick your head in.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nCloser to the walls, you raise and wave your torch wide. There\u0027s a lot of holes in the wall that look like sliverwing hives; the tunnels have a black, gooey appearance, carved with scythe-like claws and shaped with burning spittle.
