Simulation technology was practically designed, for example, to revolutionize engineering, architecture, and digital art; the consequences it held for computational neurology were nothing short of incredible, and the potential it opened for disabled individuals to access fields previously inaccessible to them could not be understated. Applying such technology to an end of vapid entertainment and puerile escapism was thought of by pioneers as an insulting waste of potential; because this new technology was, at the time, so prohibitively expensive as to be only accessible to industry professionals, the idea of using it for gaming remained strictly within the enthusiast sphere.<br><br>Now, years later, the technology is everywhere. Many individuals wear glasses-rigs in everyday life, linking wirelessly to smartphones to project augmented-reality interfaces that obviate the difficulties of modern infrastructure\u2019s complexity. You can navigate unfamiliar cities with a heads-up display that warns of traffic or inclement weather, or complete monetary transactions with the literal blink of an eye. And even though the levels of technology once only available to large top-end setups have proliferated through the consumer-grade market, the principle of virtual-reality gaming remains thoroughly enthusiast if only in the sheer indulgence of it. The idea of immersing oneself in an virtual world of anonymity and adventuresome luxury, that responds to want by shortcutting the brain\u2019s capacity for reward, would once have been considered a danger to society rather than a dream come true.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]<\/span>","filename":"1427157837862","ext":".jpg","w":738,"h":1200,"tn_w":153,"tn_h":250,"tim":1554056610077,"time":1554056610,"md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","fsize":76322,"resto":0,"id":"UY4d4r9X","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"broken-sky-online-quest-session-33","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","custom_spoiler":0,"replies":972,"images":70,"unique_ips":70,"tail_size":50},{"no":3395261,"now":"03\/31\/19(Sun)14:24:33","name":"Sylv","com":"<a href=\"#p3395258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3395258<\/a><br><br>For you, in many aspects, it is a dream come true. You find there is a certain romance to the immediacy and spontaneity of the virtual world you indulge in. Or, at least, you\u2019ve convinced yourself of this because the alternative is to think of yourself as a filthy addict. With a sigh, you lean back in your office chair and let your eyes flutter momentarily closed, thinking of what all\u2019s on your agenda. In real-space, you\u2019ve got some shopping to do \u2013 both for groceries and for some actual furniture for the new place. There\u2019s Grayson\u2019s wedding, too, this upcoming weekend; you wince and poke out your tongue in an expression of momentary distaste. Feels like all of your friends are getting married off and leaving you behind, now. With a little bit of a huff, you reach down to grab another bite of the cake donut on your desk. There\u2019s powdered sugar on your fingers; semisolid lemon-jelly crumbs fall onto your jean shorts, thankfully missing your plaid woolen shirt and dusting the tank top beneath. Maybe you are addicted to something.<br><br>Ah, well.<br><br>You\u2019ve got other friends, anyway, for as much as they\u2019re worth \u2013 or at least, you might, because it feels like someone\u2019s conspiring to take them away from you, too. Connected to you strictly through the digital frontier, they\u2019re the kind your grandparents would argue don\u2019t count as real friends, but that\u2019s hardly the point. Just a small amount of time to clear your head of emotions and thoughts of urgent, addictive necessity, has given you a clear course of action as far as what to do in simulation-space. You\u2019ve decided it\u2019s probably best to abdicate your position entirely. The Averron Alliance doesn\u2019t need you, particularly; your technological understanding will eventually be replaced or replicated by someone else, and along other avenues, Ascheritte is undeniably stronger and an overall better player than you are. Even if he is a decidedly poor strategist, he\u2019ll make a superior leader and cause less drama among the guilds by simply being. And as for the Writ Keepers? Dorian, your second-in-command and sole officer, seems either to care about your guild more than you do, or to covet your position as a leader more than you care about your guild. Under his command, you imagine, the Keepers will thrive.<br><br>It\u2019s a shame you probably won\u2019t make it back to facilitate the clean transfer of power.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]<\/span>","filename":"84129481","ext":".jpg","w":1023,"h":653,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1554056673834,"time":1554056673,"md5":"IWAIpQfpGzEg\/bsCbfrX2A==","fsize":94197,"resto":3395258,"id":"UY4d4r9X","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs"},{"no":3395264,"now":"03\/31\/19(Sun)14:26:34","name":"Sylv","com":"<a href=\"#p3395261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3395261<\/a><br><br>Mind wandering, you minimize the windows on your work desktop and stray briefly over to the imageboards.

Explosive fireballs buffet the floor around you as you dodge toward the wall of the molten fortress ahead.

You wield the Exile\u2019s blade, a paradox of light and shadow, a bar of gleaming white flame cast in crackling bilateral darkness, and you swing it with furious purpose.

You would drink the veins of a God dry for more power. <br><br>You shake your head to clear away the invasive thoughts, bracing your shield against any further incoming attacks. Your foe is powerful, but its purpose is singular: to strike by claw and by flame. These attacks are predictable, but only just; the dragon\u2019s speed and sheer aggression, still, render it a force to be reckoned with. That, and the fact that it isn\u2019t dead yet. But that\u2019s no matter; if it wasn\u2019t felled by the previous barrage, a second strike from your Celestial sword will surely end it.<br><br>\u201cTatsumaki! Gimme some space, girl!\u201d Vyx is hard to hear in the echoing noise of the place, speaking over incessant handcannon staccato. You can\u2019t imagine being on the receiving end of that barrage, under which even a dragon seems to wither. Her firepower is impressive; though you aren\u2019t aware of how much damage each successful impact inflicts on its scales and the tattered webbing of its wings, you imagine it is as if drowning in a tide of metal. You know your shield can protect from individual fireballs, and so interpose yourself between Vyx and the beast, stone shifting beneath your heels as you intercept each one.<br><br>Tatsumaki either doesn\u2019t hear or doesn\u2019t understand the verbal command. You\u2019ve moved ahead, but she darts past you and veers abruptly to the side, drawing the creature\u2019s attention away. Attacking from ambush seemed more successful than any other plan, though; here, all it takes is a swipe of the wing to send her flying into the air and bouncing across the stones. Even with your damage resistance, this foe hits like few others have; a strike like those the two of you have fielded would likely kill Nel or Cornelius outright, which makes them understandably hesitant to engage in close combat.<br><br>It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019d be able to pin this creature down like you once did the Obsidian Pegasus; the Last Argument, while a strong weapon in its own right, is unlikely to sink into the environmental stone.

But its presence cannot frighten you in your state, and through the immense pressure it exerts, the Pegasus abides. The Celestial sword emerges in a black flash, and you cast it down; an explosion bathes the room in darkness, carpet of shadow rushing away from beneath the point of impact and crawling upward the walls to vanish in the corners of the place. Stones break from the ceiling, shattering on the floor and exposing magma beneath.

I\u2019d still like to hang on to it, though.\u201d You respond. \u201cI play close to the Alliance, so anything that develops from the former isn\u2019t gonna be a surprise to you guys at all.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMore than reasonable, given your contribution to the fight.\u201d Cornelius says.<br><br>\u201cAwh. I was hoping I could keep it\u2026\u201d Nel frowns. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be able to craft a couple of armor pieces, at least.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019d hate to be insistent, but I plan to take one of these Gems. It will more than compensate for my loss today.\u201d Cornelius adds. \u201cAs for the others\u2014I would suggest Ascheritte receive the foremost, while Vyx and Tatsumaki each contributed a fair amount of damage and utility\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even have been able to get up to that ledge without me!\u201d Nel folds his arms. \u201cYour damage should count for me too!\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh, just give mine to him if y\u2019all are gonna start an argument.\u201d Vyx rolls her eyes, leering momentarily at the alluring glint of the jewels. \u201cJust remember you owe me a big time cut-in.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHang on,\u201d You suggest. If you back out of a Gem, you\u2019ll be able to get an extra unique item, or just the lion\u2019s share of the crafting materials. It would *hurt* you to do so\u2026 but you\u2019ll need upgrades if you plan to continue your pursuit. \u201cI\u2026 might back out myself, if it means I could get more of something else. If there\u2019s more Gems on the altar we can see how many we have before deciding.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAscheritte\u2019s suggestion makes the most sense. The bulk crafting resources aren\u2019t in even amounts \u2013 so some of us will have to take less of some materials and more of others. We can distribute them when we\u2019re done, and if you\u2019d like to trade we can sort it out when we\u2019re in a safe spot.\u201d<br><br>Idly, you inspect the body. The earthcrowned prophet\u2019s regalia is a layered scarlet cloth robe; though the material is sheer, it appears quite durable. Golden trim is delicately sewn in in patterns depicting the heads of dragons. Myriad chains with small golden necklaces covered in charms hang and arc between the layers of cloth.<br><br>\u201cThere are five items outside of the bulk materials \u2013 two claws, this robe, the cryst, and the egg. Does anyone want a dragon\u2019s claw more than anything else?\u201d Cornelius asks.<br><br>\u201cMe.\u201d Vyx says. \u201cYou still owe me though.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOkay, that makes that easier.\u201d He makes his way to the top of the stairs \u2013 and shudders visibly, leaning in to inspect the altar.

The martial artist, unusually, looks like he\u2019s trying to create some distance and block off your escape; closer to you is the swordsman, who\u2019s immediately in front of you when you recover clumsily from the roll, driving his sword towards your chest.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Underground: Averron Observatory \/\/ Neutral Territory \/\/ PVP Disabled ]]<\/span><br><br>The tip of the blade glints off of you in a shower of blue sparks, a grid of hard-light unfolding immediately beneath it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]<\/span>","filename":"Crow","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":810,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1554262303389,"time":1554262303,"md5":"htWnLu+5NTOKR7gYYOZwyQ==","fsize":90656,"resto":3395258,"id":"UY4d4r9X","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs"},{"no":3403005,"now":"04\/02\/19(Tue)23:34:28","name":"Sylv","com":"<a href=\"#p3402996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3402996<\/a><br><br>\u201cDamn.\u201d The swordsman says, looking down with a grin. \u201cAlmost had him.

Foremost is your Celestial Artifact. Florica warns me that it allows you to internalize the powers of your enemies. Our foes are growing more powerful, and her warnings of these Observers have become more pronounced. Her concern is that you may succumb to some manner of internal turmoil contending with these diverse powers. Mine is that they will change you. We know of great corruptive influences within this game. Should you conquer one I have no assurance it will not turn you against us.\u201d Liza says, folding her arms. \u201cNext is the magnitude of this power. The effect you just projected was able to hit players outside of the PVP zone, which may be a call to us to reassess our policies and the defensive measures we put into place to ensure that players do not harm one another or come to do so accidentally.\u201d<br><br>You nod. \u201cIs that all?\u201d<br><br>\u201cLast concerns the repercussions. If you\u2019re sure you are presently in control, I put my trust in you to handle the situation with Tethiss\u2019s Claw and the bounty placed upon you. The moment you are done, I implore you\u2014either join a guild, or start one of your own.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThis again?\u201d You ask.<br><br>\u201cNot everything is about you.\u201d Liza folds her arms. \u201cOther unaffiliated players are growing dangerously influential. The Alliance we\u2019ve formed together is strong, but there exists potential for someone like Crow or Kengo working under the radar to destroy all that we\u2019ve created. What we need now is more assurance, if we expect to make it safely to the Earthsea.\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cDo we know of anything else that can affect players in safe zones?\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cHas Florica mentioned anything to you about a Calamity?\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cIf we\u2019re really allies, why is Kainzo withholding my money?\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cCan I trust the Talents?\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.
