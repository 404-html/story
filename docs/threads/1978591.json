They are the ones who brought destruction to the world, and now watch all that is; condemning the Earthsea to ruin was merely one of their momentary whims.

Your eye catches Florica, who taps on the back of her book – a Celestial Artifact, you know – with a manicured, crimson-painted fingernail to indicate it to you. You cock an eyebrow as you look over it, almost losing yourself in the twisted, ancient symbols on the cover. It resembles the old script; you know not what it means, but feel instinctively that what it represents is offensive to your nature. “The Arcana,” You recall. “Diabolique? Your spellbook.”<br><br>“It contains the roots of this world.” Florica says. “Arts different in their nature from those of any artificer.”<br><br>“You can read that?” You ask.<br><br>“Somewhat.” Florica responds. “I am learning.”<br><br>“Right, right.” Liza shakes her head to clear her thoughts. “What was it you wanted to talk about, Ashe?”<br><br>“The Observatory, remember? I’ve been waiting to hear from the other proprietors or their organizations about investing.” You say. “I put a couple Gems in myself, but like I said, I can’t be the only one.”<br><br>“Well, we arranged a deal quite some time ago – our funds have been organized, as have those of the Writ Keepers, and we’re waiting now for the Disposable Heroes to come through with their contribution. When I pondered the possibilities, I thought it best to accord the requisite amount to simultaneously construct a pair of Advent Gates for faster travel; then, I told Kainzo – being the proprietor – to defer to you,” Liza says. “Assuming that your experience of Averron would inform the most beneficial overall decision as to how the Gems should be spent. This was a while ago, but apparently you weren’t contacted?” She looks to Kainzo.<br><br>Kainzo looks dismissively at a holographic projection from his Identifier – then over it, glancing cynically at you. “Forgive me, Liza.

You know when you die, if you keep on going as a Nameless, you’re not guaranteed to spawn back in Averron City, right? Obviously there’s a chance, since you can spawn here in the first place, but it could be any other city. Might not even be a city where you end up. Our population is, well.” He gives a whistle as he points dramatically downward with his thumb. “It’s probably stable for now, maybe even going back up, but have you wondered why it’s so quiet lately?

But it’s an interesting thought, isn’t it, to consider what she must be capable of – we officers of the Alliance are only just holding on to what we have in Averron, and she’s singlehandedly kept an entire civilization under her thumb.”<br><br>“As a tyrant.” Florica muses, a mischievous smile creeping across her face. “Or a god.”<br><br>Liza scoffs, then shakes her head. “There’s been enough fighting within the walls already for us all to know that this city would never bend to the will of a tyrant, regardless of how many of us remain. So perish the thought.”<br><br>“Averron City.

Now, they merely watch – and they target people, as if they are playing a game of their own with us. Based on what, I can’t say for sure.”<br><br>“How come more info about these guys hasn’t cropped up yet? Everyone in the world playing Broken Sky Online; you’d think if there’s nothing on the in-game boards, someone would have let something slip on the Internet proper by now?” Mendicant asks, folding his arms.<br><br>“They don’t have names.” You respond. “They break the whole user interface and scramble communications.”<br><br>“They cover their tracks.” Florica says. “It’s hard to tell when someone reports an Observer sighting versus another anomaly; the term Observer isn’t even highly popular in the public lexicon. What’s more is that message board posts go missing, often, where such things are concerned. It’s strange – even discussion outside the game ends up conveniently deleted sometimes. People have suggested that there’s a very major stance against spoilers given the nature of the game, but…”<br><br>“It’s a ridiculous thought.” Liza says. “But at this point, it would hardly surprise me.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","filename":"Kainzo.jpg","fileSize":"77 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/thumbs/1508291276081.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/thumbs/1508291276081s.jpg","md5":"AP+qPVkv+JUnxpvug3RPjg==","w":500,"h":702,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":1978591,"number":1980158,"name":"BSO","trip":"!!lUcx6J6dWDQ","id":"FZtRkOsu","time":1508291397000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/17/17(Tue)21:49:57","comment":"<a href=\"#p1979823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1979823</a><br><a href=\"#p1979800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1979800</a><br><br>“Florica, while I’m around – do you think you can craft me something else?” You ask.<br><br>“Depends.” Florica says. “Did my sword serve you well?”<br><br>“Most dependable I’ve ever used.” You nod. “’Till the Observers got hold of it, anyway.”<br><br>“I’m glad you put it to a purpose.” Florica nods. “I could spare a few moments, assuming all’s said here?”<br><br>“You’re dismissed.

There’s no way to tell once you’re under. Someone could cut your throat and as long as your gear was still on you wouldn’t even drop connection until your heart stopped.

If I don’t make it, I don’t know what’s going to happen. To the Observatory, or the Alliance…”<br><br>You shake your head. “Take it as it comes. You can do this until you’re about to fall apart but there’s no way to be ready. Is there?”<br><br>She frowns at all of the full parchment pages. There isn’t.<br><br>“Freya has their power too. A gift from them – received as a Celestial Artifact, perhaps, or some other way? – that resonates with their nature.” You add. “This famous bounty hunter called Canderence said it was the power of Lifedrain.”<br><br>“It’s not clear where they came from.” Ayla nods. “But they used an art that was unlike any other to drink the power of the gods. By the time they could no longer hide, the Celestials were weak, and they were strong. That must be it.”<br><br>“Whatever the case, it seems as if she’s betrayed them.”<br><br>“I’d worry about anyone who hopes to survive having drawn the ire of both the Celestials and the Observers.”<br><br>Another pause.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","filename":"Freya.jpg","fileSize":"102 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/thumbs/1508303566321.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/thumbs/1508303566321s.jpg","md5":"BuOsh/0BGfNJAjgLD+NXWQ==","w":403,"h":834,"tn_w":60,"tn_h":125},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":1978591,"number":1981014,"name":"BSO","trip":"!!lUcx6J6dWDQ","id":"FZtRkOsu","time":1508303644000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/18/17(Wed)01:14:04","comment":"<a href=\"#p1981011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1981011</a><br><br>“What about my Artifact?” You ask. “It’s causing strange things to happen.

Like,” You say. “What I’d imagine it’s like to reunite with a lost loved one.”<br><br>“It hits that same frequency for everyone, doesn’t it? But not everyone can possibly know what that feels like—in fact, you just said it’s what you <span class=\"mu-i\">imagine</span> it’s like, didn’t you? Not everyone knows what a crawler carapace feels like – or what a dead body smells like, right, for that matter.

Probably not as powerful or broad in scope as Celestial Artifacts, but certainly valuable in their own right.” Ayla says. “They’re rare enough that we don’t have a whole lot of information—knowledge is at a premium right now, and people are still hoarding. Probably with justification, too. Anything that gives you a leg up on the next guy makes you a commodity.”<br><br>“I might have found one with an effect on it called Nobility. No one seems to know what it does – identifying it yielded an unknown effect.” You respond, then menu over to produce the Last Argument.

As good as any, since I can’t wrap my head around how her kingdom works.” Ayla nods. “Mind tricks also aren’t well documented in this game – at least, as far as Averron’s collective knowledge goes. That’s kind of troublesome to me. People have gotten fortune teller reports about subterranean creatures with hypnotic or maddening effects, but no concrete details.”<br><br>“Haven’t heard of the effect at all, though?” You ask.<br><br>“Can’t say I have.” Ayla responds.<br><br>“Alright, thanks.” You nod. “Hey, I’m probably heading to clear a hidden area – a fire dungeon behind a secret passage. Probably has some good stuff behind it that can give you an edge…?”<br><br>“Sorry, Ashe. Like I said, I’ve got some stuff to take care of. No cheating their game, either; I’ve tried everything both times, and plan to do the same the next time it happens.” Ayla says, with a sigh of resignation.<br><br>“If you had an Artifact, though—?” You suggest.<br><br>“I do.” She responds; she subtly points to the drill, which appears to rotate exactly ninety degrees on the spot. “S’how I got that thing together. I can access my inventory without menuing and move stuff around remotely in workshop areas – lets me build to a holo-draft without help and without making any mistakes. Doesn’t matter if I’m ahead of the curve tech-wise. They took that from me too.”<br><br>“You weren’t allowed to use your Artifact?” You ask.

In Freya’s case she was supposed to betray her own people. <br><br>They can take single out players during their login to either fight them or put them into a maze, and most likely more. The strange part about this is that they seemed prepared for Ayla, taking her artifact and placing her in a maze that seems custom tailored to her skillset. We almost seemed to catch them unaware since they did not take our artifact from us and they were just strolling along the Overworld before discovering us and attacking, before retreating after we wounded but did not kill its Guardian. They also appeared to be unaware of our artifact until they saw it during our original fight with them which could be why they didn’t take it. <br><br>When in direct combat with them they have minions called Guardians which seem more bestial and savage while the Observers seem more humanoid and capable of speech. Guardians are extremely fast and strong, capable of making great leaps and closing distance in the blink of an eye. Both the Observers and the Guardians appear to be resistant to the corrosive air of the Overworld. <br><br>During our fight with the Observer (not a Guardian) within Cidren’s corpse it was capable of shedding razor like projectiles of its own shadowy biomass as well as shapeshifting. It was also capable of poisoning us through needles that penetrate with mere contact with its body. It also gave us the dazed status with a psychic scream. Worst of all is its curse ability, which renders items unusable and is spread by contact and can then be transferred from equipped item to equipped item as well as cursing several stored inventory items at random if it touches our UI. It can only be uncursed by using a celestial artifact for each cursed item or using several to create Hallowed ground which will almost certainly start an Observer siege on that area.<br><br>The only known weakness of the Observers is the white flame-light on the bodies of both the Observers and their Guardians. That’s the only way we ever killed one. It is susceptible to mundane physical attacks."},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":1978591,"number":2004753,"name":"Anonymous","id":"kM/5uzUA","time":1508822850000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/24/17(Tue)01:27:30","comment":"<a href=\"#p2003180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2003180</a><br><a href=\"#p2003994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2003994</a><br><a href=\"#p2004089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2004089</a><br>I want to point out that I already suggested a middleground compromise: starting another \"event\" for raising the Sacred Grounds and using that as an opportunity to share and receive information about Observers."},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":1978591,"number":2004757,"name":"Anonymous","id":"90NHVY+2","time":1508822939000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/24/17(Tue)01:28:59","comment":"<a href=\"#p2004753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2004753</a><br>To be honest I don't want to spend a bunch of gems on hallowed ground if all it does is uncurse items that we've already replaced and piss off the Observers.
