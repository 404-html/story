The view is as brilliant as ever, but there is no eerie silence as usual, no faint whistling of subterranean winds. Instead, there are hundreds of voices, the echoes of a crowd aggregated far below you. Nameless and Identified, a diverse mix of classes and appearances, types of weapons you’ve yet to even see before now, are constantly arriving from the outer branches.<br><br>The Averron Observatory – created personally by yourself and a group of allies after a successful raid and a duel with a corrupted spellcaster – is the staging area for a war against the creatures that now infest the underground. Troglodytes and other hideous protohuman beasts, cast out from an ancient subterranean realm known as the Earthsea, have found their way upward into the branches of Averron. They infest the hunting grounds, and will soon threaten the civilizations you've worked to create.<br><br>Your goal? Find the seam from which they pour, and have the city’s best Artificers come up with a way to seal it for good. The mass of people below you has assembled in search of opportunity; in a city like Averron, and presumably in any other city, it’s easy to be just another ground-down face in the crowd, and to become complacent in the assumption that there’s no way to be important other than to be in a top guild or to be excessively lucky. Unrest, in fact, has resulted from the distribution of fame and the exclusivity of top guilds.<br><br>Thus, for many of the people down there, this is more than a shot at experience and loot: it’s a chance to earn recognition and prestige on a battlefield of Averron’s finest.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1473537885000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)16:04","id":"aJoTo80m","name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 25 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1427157837862.jpg","fileSize":"76322 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/images/1473537885684.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/thumbs/1473537885684s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":"738","h":"1200","tn_w":"153","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"550960","threadNumber":"550943","comment":"<a href=\"#p550943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;550943</a><br><br>“Welcome,” Liza shouts. She stands to your right, clad in gold-hemmed crimson armor, an elaborate mechanical device fixed firmly in the center of her back. Her hair is straight, faintly red. Her short stature beguiles her commanding presence and immense strength. Silence washes over the crowd as she calls out; slowly, they fall quiet to listen. “And my thanks to all of those who’ve elected to answer the call to arms.”<br><br>There’s a brief cheer, interrupting the silence, before someone in the crowd shouts in response, “What’s the plan?”<br><br>“The plan is as follows: we’re under the impression that the exiles originate in the magma chamber.” Liza nods. “Form groups—raids comprised of loose organizations of smaller parties. If you have friends, stay with them. Protect one another. We’ll be organizing teams of those who believe themselves capable to sweep and clear areas; others at the vanguard will keep the troglodytes from advancing, while the long ranged attackers can serve as additional area denial and ambush control.” A pause, before she turns to face you.<br><br>“Keep in mind the numbers at work here,” Called upon, you shout, leaning over the edge to address the crowd. Beneath your cloak – black and rusted gold – the rings of your gilded chain mail clink softly as you move. A half-circlet of the same color – Strife Memoriam – runs ear-to-ear across the back of your head. “Don’t let anyone die to kill one more Exile. There’s too many of them to trade one for one. Likewise, if a party falls under attack, those nearby should move to support. If we can, we’ll have the vanguard on rotation so no one’s taking too much damage at once.”<br><br>“Crafters and gatherers,” Florica says, oversized vermillion dress fluttering about her ankles. Her features are sharp; she wears a perpetual sly smile. “Either stick to the safest available areas if you’re combat ready, or form a second group and follow the main fighting force. You’ll get a shot at materials that are, as of now, in locales that are too dangerous to access.”<br><br>“We’ll be prepared to move out soon.” Liza shouts. “Before we go, though—I’d like any willing Artifact users in the crowd to come forward. I’ll be down shortly to speak with you.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1473537988000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)16:06","id":"aJoTo80m","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Crimson Guardian Liza.jpg","fileSize":"814860 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/images/1473537988060.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/thumbs/1473537988060s.jpg","md5":"KWtb/ltt3MNMO+AxQs98QQ==","w":"1236","h":"1020","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"103"},{"isOp":false,"number":"550987","threadNumber":"550943","comment":"<a href=\"#p550960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;550960</a><br><br>She nods: a dismissive gesture, before the crowd below is taken once again by conversation.

It’s been a while since you’ve seen this few people inside, honestly; since the first posts detailing its existence went live on the message boards after your raid, the place has been stacked wall-to-wall with people seizing advantage of the myriad facilities.

You suppose Liza did kind of put them on the spot.<br><br>“This it?” The foremost of them speaks up – a woman, certainly imposing and taller than even you, clad in full armor of stone and iron – in a deep, somewhat husky voice. You haven't spent a whole lot of time around the forums, but you think you might remember her picture from there. “There’s a lot of people here to lead – not that I’m not confident, but we can’t be the only ones, right?”<br><br>“The only Artifact users, perhaps not.” Florica says. “The only leaders, certainly not. As stated, we want these people as organized as comfortably as possible. Most will form groups with friends.”<br><br>“As many as possible under those that don’t will need to be under the watch of confident types, assuming we wish to maximize the effectiveness of this endeavor.” Liza adds. “And though we concern ourselves rather frequently with the ways this game likes to segregate us, it’s no surprise that the possession of a functional Artifact renders you a cut above the rest.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1473543736000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)17:42","id":"aJoTo80m","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Candrence.jpg","fileSize":"89801 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/images/1473543736358.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/thumbs/1473543736358s.jpg","md5":"I2KuNXGs7i5nVctwJa6U9g==","w":"560","h":"835","tn_w":"83","tn_h":"124"},{"isOp":false,"number":"551635","threadNumber":"550943","comment":"<a href=\"#p551621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;551621</a><br><br>“Tell me something I don’t know.” The next of the three is a man in impractical, regal-looking attire, hair tied back.

You’ve probably heard of me?”<br><br>“I doubt anyone here has heard of you, so quit showboating. This isn’t an exhibition.” The third looks relaxed, supremely unperturbed, wielding an enormous Eastern-looking sabre with no visible sheath. You get the sense that these three are solo players – it’s a familiar feeling, looking at the way they carry themselves. “Crimson Guardian, I assume you’re to tell us where we’re needed.”<br><br>“We’ll discuss the particulars in a moment.” Liza says, projecting her UI menu. “I’m opening a chat now.

Is it too late to join the meeting?”<br><br>“How exactly do you forget something like that?” Kengo asks, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>“Oh, selective memory?” Freya smiles, briefly making eye contact with you before glancing at Liza and Candrence in sequence. “Forgive me – I might have been under the impression that with the Crimson Guardian in your midst, as well as this bounty hunter, you might have tried to do something unsavory. How could I be certain Liza wouldn’t, say, put everything aside to attack me directly, even in front of all of these people?”<br><br>“Is this your way of being friendly?” Florica asks. Liza, meanwhile, seems to be merely keeping herself under control: eyes closed, breathing deeply.<br><br>“Civil, certainly. I think I’ve done an excellent job so far.

We're more or less the best Averron has to offer, no matter how impolitic some of us are to each other. That means we're going to have to get along at LEAST until the Troglodytes are sealed. If the leaders and champions cannot get along, how will anyone else who looks to us for guidance? That said we're going to need to have a vague idea of what an artifact does, so we can coordinate better. While exact specifics would likely be great, I do not doubt all of us would rather play it close to the vest.

Supposedly, this woman’s a ‘bounty-hunter’ – looks like Freya now has two people denouncing her here, which pretty much just means more problems for you. “Gonna be a lot of people down there – she might just start offing dudes whenever she thinks no one’s looking.”<br><br>“You really think that lowly of me?” Freya asks, both hands braced around the haft of her scythe, bending forward to rest her weight on the weapon. “I’ve approached you with nothing but honesty, and—“<br><br>“You said raids and smaller parties, Liza?” You ask. “We know enough about the structure of things down there – should the different organizations be doing anything?”<br><br>“There’ll be a main fighting force, obviously: a rough organization should probably be forcing the way down toward the projected target location. Should be loose enough that injured front-liners can rotate inward to recover.” Liza says. “As we stated, those who want to take advantage of crafting and gathering should follow a distance behind this group; in terms of standard parties, though, we’ve got room for reconnaissance and outrunning, as well as keeping an eye out for ambushes and back patrols.”<br><br>“And I can’t help but expect the Seam to be serious trouble.” Florica adds. “I’m going to have to be down there to close it, but I’d really prefer to be in the company of some people who, well, mean business.”<br><br>“Understood.” You nod, unsure of where exactly you’re going to slot yourself into this plan.<br><br>“You need recon, I’m your man.” Crow says. “Well, you need anything, really, you can probably count on me, but – digression, right?

Regardless, I'm better than up and dying because of something like that, certainly better than starting drama over it, and I'm sorry I forgot that for such a long time.<br><br>Sorry about the slow turnarounds today, too - long dialogue sequences have always taken me for-fucking-ever to write, distractions (which are currently very frequent in my life and will be for the foreseeable future) notwithstanding: this thread happened to have a lot of those. Regardless, thanks to everyone for showing back up and sticking around; you guys are puttin' in the real work.<br><br>Oh, yeah.
