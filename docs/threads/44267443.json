You're much stronger, and it seems that gravity applies to you differently at times. You've made some pretty daring maneuvers yourself, and you've seen Nel take falls that you're certain would break both of your legs in real life.<br> <br>You make about as powerful a leap as you can, and stop at the height of your jump, with one foot balanced on either of your attackers' heads. A hand swipes upward at your ankle, and you move instinctively, jumping to plant both feet on the forehead of another doll—and again as that one fails to maintain her balance.<br><br>You've always hated platforming, but this is working out nicely, all things considered. About ten feet towards the hallway, atop the sea of dolls, you see Tatsumaki, who seems to have adopted the same tactic as you. She's dodging about as efficiently, but her balance is looking a lot better than yours; at the very least, it looks prettier. From here, you can also hear Vyx more clearly, shouting expletives over the crying—you can see where she is in the crowd, as she's firing her guns straight up into the air as quickly as they'll shoot. Eunoia is fluttering around in circles over the mob, whistling happily.<br><br>You're not sure where everyone else is. Hopefully, no one's been trampled.

The remainder of the room is uneventful, save for one thing: a banquet table—seated for ten, with dishes brimming with exotic-looking fruits and meats.

Barrier back up, now!” You hear Nel shout, and see his form silhouetted in the purple light overhead as he leaps toward Kjorikos from behind. The Artificer turns, appearing briefly nonplussed, as Nel lands feet first on his chest, grabbing him by the head. There's a distinct pause before Kjorikos grabs him, throwing him aside in a dusting of indigo flames with a single gauntleted hand.<br><br>Kainzo raises his barrier, shielding the two of you in time for an enormous explosion of force and wild, coiling energy to erupt from the Artificer's direction—you hear Kjorikos grunt, in what sounds like pain, and see his silhouette levitate deeper into the woods, chased away by more caster fire from outside the clearing.<br><br>“Huh.” Kainzo says, dusting himself off as the barrier dissipates. “Kid planted one of Ayla's bombs.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ HP: 23 / 35 ]]</span><br><br>Nel and Tatsumaki join you, looking pretty badly beaten up already.
