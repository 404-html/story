It's, well, we've already met, but Ayla insisted I introduce myself.” You say. “The Guardians are prepared for the expedition tonight, correct? I'll be leading one of the groups.”<br><br>“You're the one she was talking to, then?” She raises an eyebrow. “We were in the middle of a somewhat importance Alliance meeting at the time—I stressed to her that you and all of this business must be quite important, if she had to bring it up right then.”<br><br>“I'm sorry.” You say.<br><br>“I'm not upset.” She smiles, a bit to your surprise. She's difficult to read. “Ayla believes this raid will be to the benefit of the Alliance. As long as that's the case, I have no reason to distrust either of you.”<br><br>“I'm glad.” You respond. “I'm told that you wanted your guild to lead the second group.

I'll see if he's available to speak before you leave, if you'd like.”<br><br>“That would be fine,” You suggest. “One more thing, though—can we talk in private?”<br><br>There's a ubiquitous sound of armor clanking, as more heads turn. Liza gives you a confused look, then turns to the rest of the members of her guild. “Relax,” she says, “It's fine. Ascheritte, come this way.”<br><br>Upstairs, and behind the officers' seats, Liza leads you through one of the doors, which opens into an empty room with slightly washed-out looking wooden walls. As the two of you enter, she shrugs, turning to face you. “Apologies.

But we know they exist. If the range of his ability is long enough, it's possible that he could be traveling back and forth to another city.

It might not apply to you directly, but anything you learn is technically useful. Bearing that in mind, you log onto an old gaming forum that you used to frequent. <br><br>Discussion is slow, but looks relatively active. There's people discussing the classes and skill trees, and people talking about death, and what comes after. Some people are mentioning cities, too, and by name, but none of them are Averron—except in one thread, which seems to be collecting all of the information about different cities, and the Celestial Artifacts that have been created there. By Averron's name, “Crimson Wings”. A few others catch your eye, but you don't think the information will serve you well. You search the forum for Anaximander's name, but don't find anything of value; instead, you merely bookmark the link for later.<br><br>That in mind, you decide to check the imageboards. The threads here don't last too long; you're not sure if they're getting cleaned up, or the board is actually moving at lightning speed. Why is this game pay-to-play? What do you mean—it's free. Can you upgrade your account if you die? Does it actually hurt when you get attacked? I got killed: how do I get my UI back? This is wrong, the Celestial Gems are doing something to us. Shut up, you stupid fuck, it's just part of the game. Does time move slower in Broken Sky? That can't be good for your health. But that's not possible. How can the game interpret a prayer for a Celestial Artifact? Has anyone been to the fortune teller? The things he says are just completely random.
