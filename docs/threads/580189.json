Your body is crackling with malefic energy.<br><br>You are standing near the table you were seated at when you last logged out. Crow, Aelriss, Tatsumaki, and Smith are nowhere to be seen – but you feel as if someone is staring at you. You look around to pinpoint the source, unsure of whether or not this sensation is more profound than a mere feeling after what you just went through.<br><br>The NPCs – the beast-kin shopkeepers and attendants of the Observatory – usually regard you as their Keeper, welcoming you with open arms. You have to double-take to realize it: they’re currently staring at you wide-eyed, trembling or slowly turning away.

When I come up I feel like human garbage, and if I stay gone for too long I miss so much, and they keep changing the scale in both directions…”<br><br>“I’m sure that’s just part of trying to solve the problem.” Crow laughs to himself – no one is laughing with him. “The way I see, it just means I can play more without losing as much time out of my real life.”<br><br>“Agreed.” Smith adds. “I’m a rather busy man. Naturally, I appreciate the spare moments; it gives me more opportunities to indulge myself.”<br><br>You change the subject. “What’s going on right now, Crow?

Shadows dance in the dark against the distant cavern walls; this cave, too, splits off into a number of branches extending in various directions, a number of them also unexplored. It dawns on you that if you plan to journey either to the surface or to the Earthsea, you will need more than an Excavator – the city’s explorers will have to work together to generate a more complete, unified map of the territories surrounding Averron City.<br><br>“I saw movement.” Aelriss says, glaring at the cave wall, staff readied. A silken cord tied tightly around her finger warps into a strand of rainbow light; it takes the shape of Eunoia, a bird of paradise which comes to rest on her shoulder.<br><br>“Keep your eyes peeled, then, Pretty-Bird.” Crow says, constantly dialing figures into his menu and updating waypoints as he walks. “Crim-Crims are saying things are looking kind of tame at the forefront, but who knows what could be going on around us?”<br><br>“Entertaining the idea of an ambush attack?” Smith asks, and you hear a sound like that of a blender spinning up.

The cave rumbles, stalactites dislodging, as you reach from beneath the titan’s legs to hurl lightning upward into its body. Bolts of raw, violet power leap across the walls and floor of the cave, dancing brightly, casting shadows in all directions. They stretch across the ceiling and peel back from each stone and pebble in sight where they touch the ground.<br><br>You pull to your feet as you glide forward across the ground, looking over your shoulder at the creature behind you. There’s another moment – an influx of Celestial power – where the very environment is still.<br><br>On the opposite side of the beast, you see Crow rise from the shadows spread by your attack, body wrapped in a second skin of darkness, eyes aglow. He looks foreign, strange, utterly malefic in his expression and stature, in a way that leaves you instinctively concerned as to whether he is friend or foe.<br><br>Your eyes meet before the moment passes. He too appears concerned – as the NPCs in the Observatory who saw Kjorikos reflected in you – but only for an instant, before his mouth curls into a wicked grin.<br><br>Reality catches up with your actions, hitting you like a bloodrush, sights and sounds occurring all at once. Blades of dark – like throwing knives, but sharp on every surface – loose themselves from Crow’s grip as he dips in and out of the earth, and the fiend roars, enraged. Chain lightning leaps from droplet to droplet as putrid titan’s blood sprays into the air. You dodge massive fist and mace strikes, and when you cannot, you lash out with bursts of the Artificer’s sacred fire, screeching bolts crossing the distance between you and your target nearly instantaneously.<br><br>The air is buzzing with Celestial power. Your very steps enshrine a zone where the unworthy are fit to walk. Your actions demonstrate the punishment for trespassing; divine gifts bestowed into your ownership, such a crime might well be betraying the will of the Gods.
