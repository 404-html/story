Your cloak—taken from the stockpile of the mad Artificer Kjorikos—rests fluttering on your shoulders, hood pulled over your head. The rings of your gilded mail clink quietly as you come to rest. Your body is crackling with malefic energy.<br><br>You are standing near the table you were seated at when you last logged out. Crow, Aelriss, Tatsumaki, and Smith are nowhere to be seen – but you feel as if someone is staring at you. You look around to pinpoint the source, unsure of whether or not this sensation is more profound than a mere feeling after what you just went through.<br><br>The NPCs – the beast-kin shopkeepers and attendants of the Observatory – usually regard you as their Keeper, welcoming you with open arms. You have to double-take to realize it: they’re currently staring at you wide-eyed, trembling or slowly turning away. Those that do not immediately cower in fear seem to regard you with a tangible sense of otherness – as if you were a stranger or some sort of foreign intruder.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Check your group chat.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Say something aloud.

doesn’t sound unreasonable. I imagine even one so sophisticated might have such simple problems.”<br><br>\"Yeah, I had that problem once.\" Crow says. \"Didn't keep me too long, though...\"<br><br>You nod – you’re not sure how to explain exactly the trouble you had without getting weird yourself, and so elect to settle for something a bit more mundane. “I got caught up with some stuff, too. I wasn’t actually gone for long in real life, so…”<br><br>“Oh, yeah? Honestly, I figured it was something more like that.” Crow responds. “You know how this game can be, right? You're gone a minute, and...”<br><br>“Yeah, uh.” Aelriss says. “Does that bother anyone else?”<br><br>Tatsumaki shrugs, after looking pensive for a moment.<br><br>“What's up, Pretty-Bird? You’re not having fun?” Crow asks, looking over at Ael.<br><br>“I didn’t say that.” Aelriss sighs. “Just – playing has a way of really taking it out of me, especially since I’ve made a bad habit of binging. When I come up I feel like human garbage, and if I stay gone for too long I miss so much, and they keep changing the scale in both directions…”<br><br>“I’m sure that’s just part of trying to solve the problem.” Crow laughs to himself – no one is laughing with him. “The way I see, it just means I can play more without losing as much time out of my real life.”<br><br>“Agreed.” Smith adds. “I’m a rather busy man. Naturally, I appreciate the spare moments; it gives me more opportunities to indulge myself.”<br><br>You change the subject. “What’s going on right now, Crow? What should we be doing?”<br><br>“The caravan vanguard is almost at the closest hunting ground to Averron where exiles have been spotted, so they’ll likely be in combat soon. It should be a total zerg, but the skeptics are expecting them to strike back to meet our numbers after a little while; Red-Bird’s got the gatherers hanging way back and has urged the herd to stay ready for anything.” Crow says.<br><br>“So where does that leave us?” Aelriss asks.<br><br>“Currently, we’re free agents.” Crow asks. “Which leaves us with a number of options, as I’m sure you’re aware.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest aiding the frontlines.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest scouting the adjacent branches.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest shortcutting to the projected location of the Seam.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Write-in.</span>","time":1474064300000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:18","id":"tXyxxgeA","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Crow.jpg","fileSize":"90760 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/580189/images/1474064300444.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/580189/thumbs/1474064300444s.jpg","md5":"htWnLu+5NTOKR7gYYOZwyQ==","w":"500","h":"810","tn_w":"77","tn_h":"125"},{"isOp":false,"number":"580604","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">>> Suggest scouting the adjacent branches.</span>","time":1474064478000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:21","id":"WI1zEVp2","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580615","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest aiding the frontlines.</span>","time":1474064671000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:24","id":"i3h8YJ+8","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580624","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest shortcutting to the projected location of the Seam.</span><br>Operation glory hog is go","time":1474064782000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:26","id":"OIk32IDZ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580626","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">>Suggest aiding the frontlines.</span><br>Action HO!","time":1474064794000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:26","id":"VNJTjX/c","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580747","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest scouting the adjacent branches.</span>","time":1474066231000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:50","id":"Y/dCmiWp","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580752","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">>> Suggest aiding the frontlines.</span><br>this is the best option","time":1474066304000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:51","id":"Jr/S9gIQ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580768","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br><span class=\"quote\">>> Suggest scouting the adjacent branches.</span><br><a href=\"#p580585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580585</a><br>actually nvm this is the best option","time":1474066460000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/16/16(Fri)18:54","id":"Jr/S9gIQ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"580845","threadNumber":"580189","comment":"<a href=\"#p580604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580604</a><br><a href=\"#p580747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580747</a><br><a href=\"#p580768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;580768</a><br>Lame.

You pay enough mind to pull the hood of your cloak up – then, you extend your arm, launching a blast of lightning at the mace head as it swings toward you.

The cave rumbles, stalactites dislodging, as you reach from beneath the titan’s legs to hurl lightning upward into its body. Bolts of raw, violet power leap across the walls and floor of the cave, dancing brightly, casting shadows in all directions. They stretch across the ceiling and peel back from each stone and pebble in sight where they touch the ground.<br><br>You pull to your feet as you glide forward across the ground, looking over your shoulder at the creature behind you. There’s another moment – an influx of Celestial power – where the very environment is still.<br><br>On the opposite side of the beast, you see Crow rise from the shadows spread by your attack, body wrapped in a second skin of darkness, eyes aglow. He looks foreign, strange, utterly malefic in his expression and stature, in a way that leaves you instinctively concerned as to whether he is friend or foe.<br><br>Your eyes meet before the moment passes. He too appears concerned – as the NPCs in the Observatory who saw Kjorikos reflected in you – but only for an instant, before his mouth curls into a wicked grin.<br><br>Reality catches up with your actions, hitting you like a bloodrush, sights and sounds occurring all at once. Blades of dark – like throwing knives, but sharp on every surface – loose themselves from Crow’s grip as he dips in and out of the earth, and the fiend roars, enraged. Chain lightning leaps from droplet to droplet as putrid titan’s blood sprays into the air. You dodge massive fist and mace strikes, and when you cannot, you lash out with bursts of the Artificer’s sacred fire, screeching bolts crossing the distance between you and your target nearly instantaneously.<br><br>The air is buzzing with Celestial power. Your very steps enshrine a zone where the unworthy are fit to walk. Your actions demonstrate the punishment for trespassing; divine gifts bestowed into your ownership, such a crime might well be betraying the will of the Gods.
