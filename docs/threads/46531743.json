They smile wide, paws outstretched over the crystal ball in the center of the table. “Word of your Celestial Manifestation has spread far throughout this city. Have you yet seen what you can achieve by merely seizing the initiative?”<br><br>“I suppose.” You respond. You wonder how smart the fortune teller is, compared to the other NPCs.<br><br>“Be seated, then – with your partner alongside you.” The fortune teller responds, and you and Tatsumaki are seated next to one another at the table. “Much has happened since you laid Kjorikos to rest.
