Footsteps echo through the tunnels around you; you maneuver carefully through caves lit by luminescent stone outcroppings. Nearby, a waterfall pours from a small rift in the ceiling, rolling gently off rocks and running through a gap into the foggy abyss below. Faintly glowing mushrooms grow in earthen patches in the corners of covered tunnels and caves. It grows cold. You feel uneasy, like something could be watching you from the darkness, and decide to pick up your pace.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ 1/2 ]]</span>","time":1422490075000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)19:07","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 2 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1422324183059.jpg","fileSize":"396742 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37686014/images/1422490075557.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37686014/thumbs/1422490075557s.jpg","md5":"B3CpLdGgSXetSZAyFpGzeA==","w":"679","h":"1549","tn_w":"109","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"37686056","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37686014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37686014</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Underground: Averron City – Central District // Neutral Territory // PVP Enabled ]]</span><br><br>The header appears as you enter the city, and a welcoming chime indicates you've gained a level. Discovery EXP, most likely. You'll check your UI when you get a spare moment.<br><br>“Welcome.” There's a pike-wielding man at the pillars that mark the city entrance, with a UI about his waist—a player. “New arrival?”<br><br>You nod. Beyond the entrance, you can see lanterns strung between the metal buildings flanking the sidewalks, and hear the chatter of people on the streets. There's a lot of players, more than you can count, and you can see more in the windows of houses and standing over the tables of market stalls.<br><br>Behind you, a few other players are stumbling toward the city. Some of look about as lost as you do, obviously new; you wonder if they had a welcome wagon as warm as yours.

I don't get it, myself—it takes quite a few creds to start a guild, and most of 'em are going to fizzle out soon. You can't start one without five charter members, and the majority of the ones running around don't have more than eight total.” He shrugs. “There's no real leadership. Players die, there's conflicts of interest. Everyone wants to get their names out, but nothing gets done?”<br><br>“Which ones are the largest?” You ask. The group of newbies behind you is starting to crowd a little ways back, listening intently.<br><br>“The alliance surrounding Averron City is made up of three guilds. To my understanding, Disposable Heroes is leading by numbers. I'm pretty sure the name was supposed to be a joke, but so far they've been pretty good at galvanizing suicidal charges toward a unified purpose. Their officers are pretty chill, though—you'll probably run into Andor, who's sort of a personality around town. You won't get that tight-knit feeling with them, but if you join up, you'll never have a hard time finding a party.” <br><br>He continues. “Right behind them is the Writ Keepers, but they're mostly crafters and Artificers. I've heard they're really into roleplaying—moreso than everyone else, anyway, cause it's kind of hard not to roleplay in a game like this. The Crimson Guardians are in third. They've got some of the highest level players in the game so far, and they usually keep to themselves and party privately; I've been told they actually have an application process! Their leader handles all of their negotiations, and she is a /notorious/ hardass. There's a lot of smaller guilds that are pretty friendly, too. You might like that. I'd check the tavern for recruiters, or try and start your own if you think you've got the sway.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ 1/4 ]]</span>","time":1422494415000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)20:20","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"},{"isOp":false,"number":"37688031","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37687960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37687960</a><br><br>“I see. What about the nameless?” A bit of nervous shuffling from behind you; you're still gripping your weapon, ready to lash out with a spinning strike. “Are they a problem here?”<br><br>“We keep it under control. Members of the alliance ensure that this territory stays neutral, and that there's no fighting inside the city. There's some sizeable guilds that aren't part of the alliance, though; Freakshow is getting bigger every minute. Most of their recruits are pissed off nameless, and there's accusations of them just being an organized PK guild. The rest of the Averron Guard keeps a good handle on the place, but I'd be careful.” He folds his arms, and looks at the group over your shoulder. “That means all of you. Don't wander about the warehouse district alone. Averron isn't that big of a city, but it's still easy to get lost. Got that?”<br><br>“Mhm. Do the guilds have halls? What about player housing—you said it's expensive, right? Where does the money go?” You ask.<br><br>“Guild Halls are near the housing district. Everything over there is a safe haven of sorts. You can't bust into houses uninvited, and PVP is disabled inside; it's only like that in houses and dungeons, that we've seen so far.” He says. “If one of the guilds took this territory, they'd reap all the rent from housing and decide how high the tax is; as it is now, they've set up an agreement to split it between themselves and put it towards the effort to reach the surface.”<br><br>“My ass.” A roguish character pipes up from behind you. He's got a hooded cloak, leather gauntlets, and boots of some sort of reptile's skin; he's slouched a bit, and his features are softly carved, a bit feminine. “Like they're not skimming half off the top? Have you /seen/ the Guardians' leader?”<br><br>“We've no reason to disbelieve them.” The guardsman responds. “And as a member of the Averron Guard, I've a personal responsibility to trust the current ruling powers.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ 2/4 ]]</span>","time":1422494544000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)20:22","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"e4dde93b0f6171266ef3f9aa38626ad83f8757d5.jpg","fileSize":"450515 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37686014/images/1422494544895.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37686014/thumbs/1422494544895s.jpg","md5":"nquPJuSUrjozlzrxyDCvfw==","w":"1756","h":"1756","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"125"},{"isOp":false,"number":"37688096","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37688031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37688031</a><br><br>“So, are there NPCs?” You ask.<br><br>“Few.

There's also some quest-givers; all the NPCs seem killable, but we're abiding by a policy not to. They've got enormous HP totals, and we haven't determined whether or not they're a renewable resource.”<br><br>“I see.

And it's good experience, when a nameless goes rogue or a monster strays too close to the town.” He responds, then laughs. “That all the questions?”<br><br>“Yeah, sorry.

A few people are investigating the bulletin board; there's a ragtag group at a nearby table, and a nearby girl in a form-fitting outfit appears to be explaining something to a small crowd.<br><br>“Yo, check it.” Your companion elbows you in the side, pointing to a heavily-armored lance wielder at the bar; he's wearing a tabard with a red insignia. “Guardian.”<br><br>What will you do?<br><span class=\"quote\">> Other</span>","time":1422498220000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:23","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"},{"isOp":false,"number":"37689959","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br>Bulletin board.","time":1422498395000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:26","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37689964","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Go see what that girl is explaining, it might be important</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Then go up to the lancer and say you're new, ask for advice from what looks to you to be an experienced player.</span>","time":1422498401000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:26","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37689998","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Go see what that girl is explaining, it might be important</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Then go up to the lancer and say you're new, ask for advice from what looks to you to be an experienced player.</span><br><br>Hit up the board afterwords.","time":1422498483000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:28","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690035","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689964</a><br>sounds good.","time":1422498546000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:29","id":null,"name":"Sargeras","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690056","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br><a href=\"#p37689964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689964</a><br>This","time":1422498588000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:29","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690058","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br><span class=\"quote\">> Go see what that girl is explaining, it might be important</span><br><br>Then go to the bulletin board afterwards","time":1422498589000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:29","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690148","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37689881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689881</a><br><a href=\"#p37689964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37689964</a><br>Pretty much this.","time":1422498783000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:33","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690506","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"Guys what about going solo underground till we reach bottom?<br>Just exploring and gathering loot in all of these deep ruins full of exp","time":1422499463000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/28/15(Wed)21:44","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"37690562","threadNumber":"37686014","comment":"<a href=\"#p37690506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37690506</a><br>I dunno.

That's called a Celestial Manifestation?

All that was left to do was state our purpose.”<br><br>“You guys created this city, then?”<br><br>“It wasn't quite what we imagined, but it was close enough.” Ayla responds. “By the time we got there, though, we'd already realized how divergent our playstyles were.

That's when we got the idea for the alliance. It would be unfair for someone to be able to contest starter territory, so we decided...”<br><br>“To start your own guilds.” It makes sense—Ayla leads the Writ Keepers, Liza leads the Crimson Guardians, and Andor is a commanding officer of Disposable Heroes. “I get it.”<br><br>“Speaking of Andor—he's been bugging me about something weird happening at the Altar earlier.” She says. “You weren't reading this when that was going on, by chance?
