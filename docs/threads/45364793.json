Instead, she takes a fighting stance, holding the grimoire in front of her in one hand. She chooses a chapter, and the book navigates there, pages fluttering cover to cover without further input.<br><br>Florica mutters a syllable—disgusting, vulgar—under her breath in some alien language as the pages come to a stop. Behind her, a twisting, runic portal is torn open, a scar in the fabric of space that opens to an unknown, burning world. She steps aside, tossing her free hand upward majestically as if raising the curtain on a matinee, to make room for a pillar of flame to rip across the arena, scorching the floor beneath.<br><br>Mendicant moves aside at nearly imperceptible speed, from a standing position to a running dive roll. His opponent turns, circling with the portal to pursue her opponent with the flamethrower like some demonic siege weapon. The inferno strikes the glass wall in front of the arena, the fire rising to incredible height; even up here, you can feel the oppressive heat, as blinding light and a wall of fire obscures the battle for a mere moment.","time":1455247264000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/11/16(Thu)22:21","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"23059230522.jpg","fileSize":"232826 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45364793/images/1455247264675.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45364793/thumbs/1455247264675s.jpg","md5":"TIb4nXTTRZqlxiEm7jy6Vw==","w":"1465","h":"760","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"64"},{"number":"45368908","threadNumber":"45364793","comment":"<a href=\"#p45368887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;45368887</a><br>He’s in attack range, when you can see next, and she’s forced to retreat, the portal closing as she abandons her position. She’s no match for him in melee combat, weakly parrying the first of his swings with her sabre before turning and running with her sword extended. Another foreign word, different somehow from the last, and a gust of air carries her upward to a height just a few times higher than she’d be able to jump. Her dress flutters, and she falls slowly, the book’s pages turning in the opposite direction. You already recognize the red glow and distant heat of a fire spell—and she’s left her opponent in the dust, vulnerable on the ground below.<br><br>Three orbs of flame take form around her, rushing toward her opponent—and with rallying battle shouts, he cuts through each of them, taking slow steps backward as he does. Another strikes the ground in front of him, and the explosion sends him stumbling backwards.<br><br>Florica lands apart from him, and with a familiar word in the forgotten tongue, opens the portal to hell—this time, striking head-on, engulfing him in flames. The blast is shorter, and she rushes forward, sabre ready, into the wall of obscuring smoke, eager to deliver a finishing blow.<br><br>You’re shocked to hear swords clash, and see her sent flying a distance away, with her grimoire clutched tight against her chest, sabre sliding across the arena floor in a different direction.<br><br>“What!?” She shouts, and can barely gain her footing before Mendicant is upon her, standing with his blade at her throat. “How?”<br><br>“I decided on my Artifact last time I lost to you.” He responds nonchalantly, pulling his collar down with his free hand to reveal a gilded pendant around his neck. “Basically, fuck magic.”<br><br>“That’s not balanced!” She responds.<br><br>“It is.” He says. “I waited until I knew your guard was down; it only lasts a limited time.”<br><br>“Really?” She smiles, gaze narrowing. “Then you’ve still lost.”","time":1455247336000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/11/16(Thu)22:22","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"under_city_by_wen_xaeroaaa-d5i8f3b.jpg","fileSize":"70325 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45364793/images/1455247336206.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45364793/thumbs/1455247336206s.jpg","md5":"k5eyeK53qRhyUmR9dd28rA==","w":"900","h":"352","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"48"},{"number":"45368940","threadNumber":"45364793","comment":"<a href=\"#p45368908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;45368908</a><br>She pushes herself into a backward somersault—ungraceful, but functional, as Mendicant’s sword thrust falls short, and his upper body tilts forward, off balance.

I hope you’re ready to be… utterly humiliated.”<br><br>She turns, leans over to pick up her sword, and is hit in the back of the neck by a thrown knife. It embeds itself to the handle, and she falls flat onto the ground, twitching a bit before a flash of blue light washes over the two of them. The knife vanishes as the duel comes to an end.<br><br>The crowd erupts into equal parts laughter, cheering, and booing.<br><br>“What an upset!” The bet collector shouts. “Mendicant’s won, against the odds!
