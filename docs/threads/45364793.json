She chooses a chapter, and the book navigates there, pages fluttering cover to cover without further input.<br><br>Florica mutters a syllable—disgusting, vulgar—under her breath in some alien language as the pages come to a stop. Behind her, a twisting, runic portal is torn open, a scar in the fabric of space that opens to an unknown, burning world.

His opponent turns, circling with the portal to pursue her opponent with the flamethrower like some demonic siege weapon.

She’s no match for him in melee combat, weakly parrying the first of his swings with her sabre before turning and running with her sword extended. Another foreign word, different somehow from the last, and a gust of air carries her upward to a height just a few times higher than she’d be able to jump. Her dress flutters, and she falls slowly, the book’s pages turning in the opposite direction.

Another strikes the ground in front of him, and the explosion sends him stumbling backwards.<br><br>Florica lands apart from him, and with a familiar word in the forgotten tongue, opens the portal to hell—this time, striking head-on, engulfing him in flames.

It embeds itself to the handle, and she falls flat onto the ground, twitching a bit before a flash of blue light washes over the two of them.
