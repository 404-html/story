You see it when you stop and glance at your reflection in the glass Observatory windows, or the reflective surface of a smooth metal wall nearby. Projected from your cloudy iris is a ring of faint light: a never-ending wheel of memory envisaged as a pixilate data stream. Aelriss looks at you, concern wrinkling her brow, and you meet her gaze, examining her for a moment. Her white hooded cloak is wrapped around her shoulders as a luxuriant and majestic comfort, voluminous blonde braid spilling down her front. You wonder, very briefly, how close the perfect appearance of her digital avatar matches her—or you suppose it could be his—real life appearance, but reconcile the notion when a momentary thought affirms that you can’t imagine her any other way.<br><br>“Well?” You ask. Aelriss turns to Tatsumaki, standing catatonic and dull-faced nearby.<br><br>“Still nothing.” The artificer waves her hand in front of the shorter girl’s face as if to attempt to rouse her back into reality. “She’s totally zonked.”<br><br>“You think something happened to her?” Your eye twitches. You need more Celestial Gems. Taking a few steps closer to the group, you fold your arms, leaning forward as though to inspect Tatsumaki. Her usually-grinning face is joyless; the rosy sliver that often lines her cheeks is absent. She stands petrified, vacant of both idle motion and the swaying of breath.<br><br>“Outside of the fact that I think she’s been offline for like… less than a few real-time minutes since Kjorikos? I don’t even know what it was like before I met her.” Aelriss purses her lips. “Kind of assumed it was just like this.”<br><br>“She knocked out, then.” You respond.<br><br>“Maybe? She’s still standing here, which means she’s still linked up.” The artificer frowns. “I’m kind of feeling it myself, and I’ve been on for just as long. Not tired, just—spaced. I don’t even really know what time it is overhead, y’know? Never occurred to me that you could just knock out.”<br><br>“Can you?” You ask, after a pause.","filename":"1427157837862.jpg","fileSize":"75 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3437745///i.4cdn.org/qst/1555369709739.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3437745///i.4cdn.org/qst/1555369709739s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":738,"h":1200,"tn_w":153,"tn_h":250},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":3437745,"number":3437747,"name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","id":"zQdneY4M","time":1555369740000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/15/19(Mon)19:09:00","comment":"<a href=\"#p3437745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3437745</a><br><br>“I mean, your brain’s still ticking, right? That’s how we’re playing—we’re conscious, and the program is… interpreting the data we’re sending the rig, I guess.” Aelriss says. “Even if you didn’t need food and stuff, you’d have to stop the connection to rest eventually, or you’d just pass out in-game.”<br><br>“The game sends some kind of signal to start that connection, though.”<br><br>“So?” Aelriss quirks a brow.<br><br>“If it’s putting you to ‘sleep’, can you ever really wake up? Or—can it stop you from ‘waking up’, so you can’t pass out and fall asleep?” You ask. “What do you think would happen if someone just kept you awake so long that…”<br><br>“Ashe, I don’t really want to think about this.” The blonde gives a nervous laugh. Your UI pings from a notification, but you’re distracted by the sight that occurs concurrently: the martial artist flickers, vanishing from reality behind a blue scan line that washes over her from head to toe.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Tatsumaki is offline. ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ UI Messenger – Group Chat (Averron City’s Finest) ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Tatsumaki has left chat. ]]</span><br><br>“…and it looks like you’re worrying about nothing, anyway. Just hope she’s feeling alright.” Aelriss says. She opens her own UI menu, thumbing between screens. “Maybe we should take a break too, huh? God only knows how long it’s been.”<br><br>“I got stuff I need to take care of as soon as possible, in case you didn’t realize. Plus, do you know how much could happen in the time that’d take with this game’s fucked-up time-scale?” You give Aelriss an incredulous look.<br><br>“That’s… a good point. The length of a night’s sleep could be literal days in-game. You could take a day off and come back to an entire different world, or a new political regime, or something equally stupid.” Aelriss tilts her head back at you. “Do you think that’s intentional?”<br><br>“Now who’s coming up with conspiracy theories?” You ask.<br><br>“I mean it, though—this is legit. Like, maybe that’s why why Liza and Anaximander are so focused on passing their ideology down: so that people can carry out their will in their absence.” Aelriss says.<br><br>You’re not sure what to say, since you’re not sure what you believe. She might suggest that there’s people that have figured this game out already. Maybe that’s the case—but if you happened to know any of them, you’re certain that things in Averron would be different than they are now. Your thoughts trend momentarily toward that absence as you look over at Tatsumaki’s empty space in the room. No other game you’ve played before has managed to feel like your friends are disappearing around you.<br><br>Perched on Aelriss’s shoulder, Eunoia whistles sweetly.","filename":"Aelriss.jpg","fileSize":"111 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3437745///i.4cdn.org/qst/1555369740565.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3437745///i.4cdn.org/qst/1555369740565s.jpg","md5":"w73UsJub4uJHjQ+fYu2FWA==","w":1000,"h":605,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":3437745,"number":3437752,"name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","id":"zQdneY4M","time":1555369821000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/15/19(Mon)19:10:21","comment":"<a href=\"#p3437747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3437747</a><br><br>You need to...

You have caused me a lot of trouble.”<br><br>“<span class=\"mu-i\">Aasiva.</span>” She spins eerie purple thread between her fingers, dangling a round of sinister-seeming cord and stretching it in her hands as if to test its tensile strength. You have no doubt she was being decidedly literal and quite serious in her intention to ‘put you to the lash’. You watch her carefully, remaining ready to move, but are content when she seems to stop a short distance away, deciding she’s close enough for polite conversation.<br><br>“What’s that?” You ask.<br><br>“’Between’. My age is showing, I suppose.” Tethiss gives a humorless little laugh.

So long as you have cleansed yourself of the influence from between, we may speak on civil terms.”<br><br>Your squint indicates scrutiny, betraying your attempt to appear impassive.

I have seen your visions and felt your desire.” Only when the araneid queen corrects her posture do you realize she’s been slouching.

You see Florica move out of the corner of her eye, and turn to watch her draw the Diabolique into her lap.<br><br>“I assumed as much.” Florica says. “And you still believe she can be trusted, Ascheritte? You put her life in her hands a moment ago, and she would have taken it from you had I not intervened.”<br><br>“Conveniently you forget that this gift was granted to me by Celestial investiture.” Freya says, flexing the fingers of the Herald’s Hand. “This Artifact has the same power over me as yours does over you, and as Florica’s tome of dark magic over her. But you… <span class=\"mu-i\">hate</span> me, because you know for certain the power I hold.”<br><br>“The Observers are our enemies, Freya. They’ve tried to take us out and they’ll do worse. There’s so much going on that we don’t understand—and you’re apparently a conduit to their influence?”<br><br>“I don’t trust it in the least.” Florica says. You look to her, and she stores her grimoire away when she sees your gaze drawn to it. “How could the Celestials grant you the power of the Observers—and why would they? What we know best is of their corruptive power, and how they dwell within those that accept their gift. I plan to tell the Alliance that you have become a puppet to their will.”<br><br>“This art has availed me much, you know. I have it to thank for making it this far, and plan to nurture it—such that I may use it against its makers. If we’re to believe the story of this world, the power of Observers has killed the gods once before. But you cast me out for knowing. You reject all those who challenge your own reality, then go to fight the Observers with Celestial powers that have failed to destroy them once already.” Freya says. She turns her hand over as if assessing her own discolored flesh, and the runic mark that adorns her palm. “I want to believe in you, Ascheritte. But it makes perfect sense that one so predicated on recreating memories would be borne to repeat history.”<br><br>The mystic eye burns, threads of fire seeping into your skull. You grit your teeth, stepping back. Florica’s hand settles on the hilt of her saber.<br><br>“I’m so sick of listening to you guys!” Nel shouts. “You’re all being fucking controlled by your Artifacts! I thought you were better than this, but everything everyone’s saying about you is right!”<br><br>“Nel, chill out.” Aelriss stands, taking a step towards you. “This isn’t working. Can we have this talk somewhere else?”<br><br>“We’re not going to have another chance.” Florica says.<br><br>“I’m going back, Ashe.” The Explorer brings up his map and starts down the path. Aelriss sighs, then looks to you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.

There were rumors that people were going to take her to war over censoring BH threads on the forums.” Nel says.<br><br>“Who’s making the weapons?” You ask. “Liza told me a little bit about the Talents. It could be one of their affiliates, or someone who stole from them.”<br><br>“They’re part of the Alliance, aren’t they?” Aelriss asks.<br><br>“They’re not.” Florica responds. “It’s complicated.”<br><br>“That seems not good.” Aelriss says. Freya gives a small smile—even when her life’s in danger, it seems she gets a little kick out of seeing the Alliance in disarray.
