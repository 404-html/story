You know that for a fact. You can log out and check. You’ve been playing for a comparatively little cut of time when you consider the fact that Broken Sky Online has kept your brain ticking for <span class=\"mu-i\">days</span> on end – hours upon hours of constant travel or high-flying, life-threatening combat. What is it that you’re feeling, then? How long can you, and everyone else in Averron and the rest of the underground for that matter, tolerate such a thing? Ayla said it herself: if this is the way things are, you could step away from the game for hours and come back having missed virtual days – weeks, even. Something has to give. You wonder where the equilibrium will lie when all’s said and done.<br><br>“Ashe, what the fuck?” Nel says, slugging you in the shoulder; you start in place, jumping a little bit in your seat. “You told me you were okay! Are you lying to me?”<br><br>“Yeah.” You nod. Your hands are shaking a bit, hovering inches above a holographic display projected from your UI; that’s right, you were making a to-do list. You’ve been feeling a tad forgetful for some reason. You need more Celestial Gems. There’s a notification, too; it looks like you have an unread message as of a few minutes ago. “Did I space out again?”<br><br>“This is the third time since we got up here.” He sighs.<br><br>“Oh.” You respond, genuinely unaware. “What do I… do? Just stare?”<br><br>“Mostly.” Nel says, expression indicating genuine concern. “Like there’s something on your mind. And you move your mouth, too! Like you’re whispering to yourself – counting, maybe, or trying to remember something. It’s – uhm, creepy.”","time":1507156716000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/4/17(Wed)18:38","id":"5MgKH1+U","name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 31 ]]","trip":"!!lUcx6J6dWDQ","filename":"1427157837862.jpg","fileSize":"76322 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1931372/images/1507156716180.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1931372/thumbs/1507156716180s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":"738","h":"1200","tn_w":"153","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"1931375","threadNumber":"1931372","comment":"“You’re scared of everything, Nel.” You look askance at him.<br><br>“Am not.” He pouts, then grumbles a bit, distracting himself by looking out over the Observatory grounds or checking the message boards on his UI.<br><br>“Hey.” Aelriss’s voice comes from behind you after a quiet few moments, and you look over your shoulder to watch her approach; her characteristic white cloak, hem fluttering around her legs, is now adorned at the hip with a finely-crafted shortsword. Tatsumaki’s with her, too, wearing a form-fitting black bodysuit beneath her light armor. “You two dating now?”<br><br>“I proposed to you already, remember?” You hop to your feet and swivel around, resting against the railing with your arms folded. “You didn’t give me a solid answer.”<br><br>“Sorry, Ashe. Mama said never bring home a DPS.” She shoots you a bare-toothed grin. Tatsumaki is smiling too, but you can’t imagine why since she probably isn’t getting most of this conversation. Maybe she’s just happy to be with her friends.<br><br>“Suit yourself.” You afford a dismissive shrug and a smirk. “Spend your whole life waiting for the one, and you’re gonna be all alone with your bird before you know it.”<br><br>“Joke’s on you; that’s my ideal.” Aelriss says.<br><br>“Weren’t you going to take a break, Ael?” Nel asks.<br><br>“Was.” She responds. “I logged and relogged.

I’d tell you not to bother trying to reverse-engineer their technology, but precise instructions are completely wasted upon the likes of you.” At this, he gives a bit of a laugh. “The entities whom have now deemed you personally worthy of destruction – the Observers, as you now know them – are the same ones who once grew powerful enough to subjugate gods. They are the ones who brought destruction to the world, and now watch all that is; condemning the Earthsea to ruin was merely one of their momentary whims.

She is more capable than the lesser araneids – and weaves shadow magic like her own viziers. They organize themselves through a hive-mind connected to her.” The fortune-teller says, nodding sagely at you. “She knows you have stolen from her, Ascheritte. You must bleed every drop of her life from your body if you wish to be judged fairly in her court.”<br><br>“…What?”<br><br>“The silk of araneids is a useful crafting material, as it is very light but surprisingly strong when properly worked. It would be worthwhile to collect some if you wish to expand your wardrobe. The araneids will utilize their own silk to craft ranged weapons, as well as pitfall traps. Be wary of those, as well as the true spiders who live commensally with araneids, if you seek to traverse the Claw.”<br><br>You shake your head and sigh, more credits deducting from your chip.<br><br>“What can you tell me about this?” You ask, holding up the Symbol of Fire.<br><br>“It is a key to a hidden fortress in the magma chamber, which was once protected by the Earthcrowned Phoenix.” The fortune teller responds. “The Entombed who defeated the Earthcrowned Phoenix, named Linastra, failed to discover the hidden door. She kept the Symbol of Fire and planned to return, until she was killed when an araneid caused her to fall from a great height. She was incapacitated, but landed within the reach of the King’s Hand. I will mark the entrance on your map, if you wish. Bring protection against fire, for I sense a roaring flame within.”<br><br>“Where can I find hallowed ground?” You ask.<br><br>“Your best bet would be to utilize a Greater Materialization Altar to erect a permanent shrine to the Celestials.

That kind of thing is a big deal in hardcore play, even if you’re as good at this game as she is.”<br><br>Tatsumaki shrugs.<br><br>“You already know how I feel, Ashe. Guildless for life.” Nel folds his arms. “You’re not going soft, are you?”<br><br>“Guilds have benefits, Nel.

We could make it work.”<br><br>“…Maybe.” He turns away, grumbling a bit. “Doesn’t matter, though. You need five charter members and I count four of us – so unless you know someone as reliable…”<br><br>“There’s the solo all-stars. Crow, and Kengo – and that healer girl. Aelriss’s friend Donnel, too?” You ask.<br><br>Ael shakes her head. “He’s a great guy, but I don’t think he’s the kind of guy you’d want in your guild. Ashe. His go-to solution to the Nameless problem comes at the edge of his sword.”<br><br>“They did try to kill you, Ael.” Nel adds.<br><br>“They’ve tried to kill all of us.” You sigh. “You can’t simplify the problem that much.”<br><br>“What about the bounty hunters? You kind of know one of them, right?” Aelriss asks.<br><br>“No way! Have you seen the way they post on the forums?” Nel says. “They’d just do all kinds of crazy stuff behind your back.”<br><br>“There’s Smith. He’s pretty dependable.” You suggest.<br><br>“He’s kind of a creep, Ashe.” Aelriss rolls her eyes. “No offense to you or anything.”<br><br>You change the subject. “Nel, heard of any big marks around here recently?”<br><br>“There’s something called an Underground Siren, apparently – burrowed up from who knows where.” He responds. “I can send you its whereabouts, but it’s got a <span class=\"mu-i\">lot</span> of recorded kills.

The strider screeches, crashing downward toward the stone beneath, and you afford a battle shout as a response, a hissing cry in a voice unlike your own that might well intimidate a man as well as a mere animal. As it falls, its leg follows through, swinging up to crash into your ribcage; you turn to avoid the worst of the blow, and your armor absorbs the remainder of the damage, but you’re batted aside, flying out from above the coverage of the outcropping and falling a distance.

Another punch, and another send the two of them together, measure by measure, down towards the molten rock. The creature whirls with unexpected speed, and she’s sent flying from its body, recovering midair and landing precariously on a stalactite over the lava; she looks around, confused for a few moments as if she’s wondering how to get out of this predicament, before she begins leaping from rock to rock on the deceptively long journey back up towards you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Leap back to the stone platform and fight it on even ground.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Climb back up towards Aelriss and Nel.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Attempt to make it above a stable landing, then deal a killing blow with the Memory of Exile’s special attack.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Other (Write-in.)</span>","time":1507254882000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/5/17(Thu)21:54","id":"5MgKH1+U","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!!lUcx6J6dWDQ","filename":"3462476335.jpg","fileSize":"171253 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1931372/images/1507254882509.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1931372/thumbs/1507254882509s.jpg","md5":"8FpCYrFUSGM47QW1PKcaaw==","w":"800","h":"800","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"125"},{"isOp":false,"number":"1934514","threadNumber":"1931372","comment":"<a href=\"#p1934501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1934501</a><br>Actually on second thought this one seems to channel the corrupting power that the Observers granted to the Cidren.

Currently in battle, we are definitely a powerhouse while under our artifacts influence. We are also versatile in pretty much any situation, due to Strife Memoriam's nature.<br>Our main problem right now is how vulnerable we are when we cannot use our artifact. This is why I believe repairing The Last Argument of Kings and increasing Strife Memoriam's capabilities is worth investing in.<br>That being said I am not opposed to creating a new artifact, but I do have two concerns.<br><br>1: Multiple artifacts will become expensive to maintain and arguably less effective than maxing the capabilities of one.<br><br>2: Everyone has their own unique ideas for artifacts and it would be hard to come to a consensus regarding a new one. (I actually had a lot of fun reading through the potential artifacts everyone thought up)<br><br>The Observatory is definitely a different matter and I think there is an easy solution. <br>Personally when it comes to the Observatory I can agree with any suggestions to improve it. Improving the Observatory helps everyone in Avveron. However the Observatory was gained by the efforts of everyone that helped us during that raid. It is not ours alone, therefore any changes to it should be agreed on and invested in by the Avveron Alliance. This isn't a bad thing. We can bring our concerns regarding the Observatory to the Alliance and they should help in it's growth. Why wouldn't they? Everyone wins.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Stat Upgrades</span><br><br>I'm pretty much fine with whatever route we decide to take. Increasing hp/pp is always helpful and almost every combat upgrade we choose will help at this point. Personally I think we should max anything that will further reduce fatigue from using oversized weapons since we are already heading in that direction. I also think it would be worth investing in pp so we can use a few more Concussive Strikes. To give us an edge while not under Strife Memoriam's influence. Again I'm fine with whatever everyone chooses.

We can basically join any guild at this point or create our own. When Sylve takes up a major interest in Broken Sky again and drops a starting date I plan on reading everything from the start (because it's so good). So I'll have a better idea of the general interest each guild in Avveron has right now. As far as I remember the biggest controversies regard the equality and freedom of players in Avveron. All of them seem to have valid points as well. For now I just want to suggest a path we can take, since there's a lot of interest in either creating a guild or remaining guildless. <br><br>We could create a small elite guild of players we personally trust. Ideally 5 to 10 members. This guild's main objective would be expanding Avveron by defeating Precursors and developing that area. This is basically the general goal in Broken Sky. By establishing our own guild we can keep our friends close, separate ourselves from choosing a side in the current state of Avveron, and at the same time create a situation where we can have a substantial influence on guild politics. There's a lot I hope we could accomplish by doing this. Some of our ingame friends are torn between the stress of joining a guild. Ours however would solely be to organize for raids. Joining this guild will give you a very real chance of defeating a Precursor and receiving everything that comes with it (celestial gems). Basically our members can expect a \"Hey want to raid this dungeon?\" Or a \"Hey let me know if you find a dungeon\" besides that they are welcome to do whatever they want. This should create an environment where even players that don't get along can join, since there's really no need to spend anytime together outside of raids. If we create this guild we can explain to Liza that this is the best way we can be of help to Avveron. Our sole goal being the expansion of our territory we want to have our most trusted and able contacts ready for any raid we encounter. At the same time tell her as a guild leader we would like to join the Alliance. If she agrees we can still request members of different guilds to assist in our raids if we're short a few members. As well as influence the political scene in a positive way. If all of this goes well we can explain to Freya that after the event we faced together we thought this was our best course of action. Personally I'm starting to understand Freya's philosophy. Ideally we should try to create a democratic system in the Alliance where Freya can voice her opinions. For now we tell Freya we consider her an ally and we hope she can assist us in any upcoming raids. Defeating a Precursor with members of Freakshow and Crimson Guardians is definitely a step in the right direction.<br><br>Any criticism is greatly appreciated~","time":1507746967000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/11/17(Wed)14:36","id":"j1tk1NAx","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"1954587","threadNumber":"1931372","comment":"<a href=\"#p1954544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1954544</a><br>There's no point to making a guild like that in my opinion.
