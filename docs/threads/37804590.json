You hear running water from outside, and the sound of distant hoof-beats on stone, but not much else. There's a pronounced hollowness to your own steps, and through cracks and gaps in the brick floor, you think you can see something below. A basement, perhaps an underground river? Likely, more of the abyss you beheld from above.<br><br>You and Nel are leading the group, with the other three following close behind as you walk down the aisle, weapons at the ready. He created a pretty suitable map of the area, but it's not terribly complicated. There's six pillars, three on either side of the room past the disheveled pews; it seems they once held up the ceiling, but are now mostly broken, though they still stand much taller than you. It's dusty, and dark, save for a faint light from outside, and more flecks of glowing quartz in the ceiling above.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ 1/2 ]]</span>","time":1422923994000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/2/15(Mon)19:39","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 5 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1422721374608.jpg","fileSize":"888348 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37804590/images/1422923994829.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/37804590/thumbs/1422923994829s.jpg","md5":"vJKA258z3Cf1eLm+YUcyfw==","w":"2560","h":"1600","tn_w":"250","tn_h":"156"},{"number":"37804613","threadNumber":"37804590","comment":"<a href=\"#p37804590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37804590</a><br><br>Behind you, the exit.
