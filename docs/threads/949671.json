The beating of footsteps – an army of distant allies – reverberates through the caverns overhead, dislodging bits of rock and dust that rouse you to alertness as they tumble down around you.

Cut from a different type of stone, they appear out-of-place at best and somehow-malicious at worst. Thick threads, white and wispy – spiders’ webs – stretch between them, roped around the stalagmites in reticulated stretches and swaths. There’s little pitter-patters on the ceiling. You might see movement in the shadows when you gaze overhead, though you want to believe that your eyes deceive you.<br><br>You and your group exchange nervous glances, while Freya – the current leader of Freakshow, who seems to know a fair bit about this place – leads you along the path.
