The Artificer turns, appearing briefly nonplussed, as Nel lands feet first on his chest, grabbing him by the head. There's a distinct pause before Kjorikos grabs him, throwing him aside in a dusting of indigo flames with a single gauntleted hand.<br><br>Kainzo raises his barrier, shielding the two of you in time for an enormous explosion of force and wild, coiling energy to erupt from the Artificer's direction—you hear Kjorikos grunt, in what sounds like pain, and see his silhouette levitate deeper into the woods, chased away by more caster fire from outside the clearing.<br><br>“Huh.” Kainzo says, dusting himself off as the barrier dissipates. “Kid planted one of Ayla's bombs.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ HP: 23 / 35 ]]</span><br><br>Nel and Tatsumaki join you, looking pretty badly beaten up already.

You struggle to maintain your footing as the earth breaks; the raid members flee along separate lanes formed by deep fissures opening in the ground below, leading into darkness.<br><br>“So you're just going to destroy it?” Ayla is standing on the edge of a newly-formed stone outcropping, accenting her inquiry with shots from her dual casters.

Whatever you're standing on isn't going to last, and you stumble toward cover from the raging storm. Ayla's got nowhere to go, and is climbing the rock face, totally exposed.

You have to dodge, and tumble backwards into what's left of the woods as another eldritch bolt obliterates your previous foothold. You start back towards the Artificer, buffeted by harsh winds that threaten to throw you off the edge, looking back up in time to see his fire blast go wide, destroying the shelf under Ayla—leaving her free-climbing.

She is thin, and ghostly, and in royal dress; she hangs, by one arm, from the edge of a small shelf about fifteen feet below you. She is the woman from the empty picture frame.<br><br>“...Velika?” You ask. Then, you stagger, catching your breath, when your eye catches the decorative brooch in the center of her chest.
