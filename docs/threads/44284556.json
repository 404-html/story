Barrier back up, now!” You hear Nel shout, and see his form silhouetted in the purple light overhead as he leaps toward Kjorikos from behind. The Artificer turns, appearing briefly nonplussed, as Nel lands feet first on his chest, grabbing him by the head. There's a distinct pause before Kjorikos grabs him, throwing him aside in a dusting of indigo flames with a single gauntleted hand.<br><br>Kainzo raises his barrier, shielding the two of you in time for an enormous explosion of force and wild, coiling energy to erupt from the Artificer's direction—you hear Kjorikos grunt, in what sounds like pain, and see his silhouette levitate deeper into the woods, chased away by more caster fire from outside the clearing.<br><br>“Huh.” Kainzo says, dusting himself off as the barrier dissipates. “Kid planted one of Ayla's bombs.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ HP: 23 / 35 ]]</span><br><br>Nel and Tatsumaki join you, looking pretty badly beaten up already.

aphotic storm forms no more than twenty or thirty feet off the ground, then begins spewing bolts of hideous lightning in all directions. You struggle to maintain your footing as the earth breaks; the raid members flee along separate lanes formed by deep fissures opening in the ground below, leading into darkness.<br><br>“So you're just going to destroy it?” Ayla is standing on the edge of a newly-formed stone outcropping, accenting her inquiry with shots from her dual casters. A blast of lightning from above sets the forest alight, raising an enormous wall of flames in the treeline; an explosion blows her platform away, sending her tumbling down onto a tiny ledge overlooking the abyss. <br><br>“Such strong emotions. Are you afraid of loss?” You watch the Artificer make his way to the edge of the fissure, preparing to follow up with a flurry of his own. “Yes, your fate is already sealed.”<br><br>The earth below you bucks and roils. Whatever you're standing on isn't going to last, and you stumble toward cover from the raging storm. Ayla's got nowhere to go, and is climbing the rock face, totally exposed. Kjorikos is drawing a circle of violet flames, aimed at her; then, Tatsumaki leaps up from the pit behind him, knocking him across the head with a gauntleted fist.<br><br>Energy's welling up again. You have to dodge, and tumble backwards into what's left of the woods as another eldritch bolt obliterates your previous foothold. You start back towards the Artificer, buffeted by harsh winds that threaten to throw you off the edge, looking back up in time to see his fire blast go wide, destroying the shelf under Ayla—leaving her free-climbing. He's got Tatsumaki by the neck, holding her up—as she struggles uselessly—in one hand, and throws her flat against the cliff face on the opposite side of the gap.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1450659820000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/20/15(Sun)20:03","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"},{"isOp":false,"number":"44289774","threadNumber":"44284556","comment":"<a href=\"#p44289548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44289548</a><br><br>It's a hell of a jump.

He tosses himself onto his stomach, flat against the edge of the fissure, to catch Tatsumaki with one hand. But now, he's starting to slide off, too.<br><br>Then, you get the distraction you're looking for. Kainzo and Nel are next to meet the Artificer, and he's a match for both of them, holding them at bay as swords and daggers clash with armored gauntlets. He's ignoring Vyx's shots from the opposite end of the clearing; she's having enough trouble aiming as it is. You look back at the gap, with Andor, Tatsumaki, and Ayla all on the cusp of falling, and wonder how long those two can duel Kjorikos, even injured as he appears.<br><br>“Aelriss!” You turn, and shout to her, a different fissure now separating the two of you. “I need you to—!”<br><br>She's standing frozen, trembling, cut off from you by a growing wall of raging fire.<br><br>Only Eunoia joins you, whistling gravely as it lands on your shoulder.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ HP: 30 / 35 ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ PP: 5 / 8 ]]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1450660513000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/20/15(Sun)20:15","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"},{"isOp":false,"number":"44289780","threadNumber":"44284556","comment":"<a href=\"#p44289548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44289548</a><br><s>This is gonna be one of those \"you can only save one\" choices, isn't it?</s>","time":1450660526000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/20/15(Sun)20:15","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null},{"isOp":false,"number":"44289836","threadNumber":"44284556","comment":"<a href=\"#p44289774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44289774</a><br><br>“Ascheritte...” Just when you think there's enough bullshit going on already, a woman's voice calls out to you from the fissure adjacent... in the opposite direction from the rest of the raid. You glance over, and see a familiar face—but fair-skinned and cream-colored, rather than marbleized as you're familiar with. She is thin, and ghostly, and in royal dress; she hangs, by one arm, from the edge of a small shelf about fifteen feet below you. She is the woman from the empty picture frame.<br><br>“...Velika?” You ask. Then, you stagger, catching your breath, when your eye catches the decorative brooch in the center of her chest.
