You’ve equipped some different gear, as well – trading out what of your equipment suffered the curse to whatever else you have on hand. Currently, you wield your old scimitar and wear leather boots; additionally, you slide the earthsea royal signet ring onto one of the fingers of your right hand, feeling a momentary humming in your mind upon doing so.<br><br>Thus, you depart up the slopes from the Calamity Rift.<br><br>“I’m not convinced.”<br><br>There’s a long, deliberate stall. You pause in your tracks and look over your shoulder at Freya, who cocks an eyebrow at you, folding her arms.<br><br>“You’re not convinced about what, now?” She asks.<br><br>“You’re inviting me to join Freakshow, and I’m not really feeling the pitch.” You respond, giving a dismissive gesture. “You haven’t really told me why I should get involved with you – just why I <span class=\"mu-i\">shouldn’t</span> get involved with the Alliance. You’re not lacking confidence, are you?”<br><br>“What? Never.” Freya responds. “I’m marketing to my target audience – <span class=\"mu-i\">you</span> just happen to be a hard sell. How else could someone rub shoulders with the likes of both the Guardians and the Writ Keepers and remain guildless? I merely didn’t want to waste time feeding you impertinent information. But, if you <span class=\"mu-i\">prefer</span>…”<br><br>“That’s enough. What does your guild actually want to achieve?” You ask. “Because orchestrating an attack on Averron City was not exactly what I’d call good PR.”<br><br>“That was a regrettable incident, yes.” She looks unperturbed. “Anaximander was rather heavy-handed in his approach – though he wanted to make a statement, and <span class=\"mu-i\">was</span> rather successful in doing so. To be quite honest? I’m not even sure I understand now what he once hoped to achieve. The fact of the matter, though, is that we’ve secured peace.”","time":1482881291000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/27/16(Tue)18:28","id":"XrT+CxR1","name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 29 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1427157837862.jpg","fileSize":"76322 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/980053/images/1482881291049.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/980053/thumbs/1482881291049s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":"738","h":"1200","tn_w":"153","tn_h":"250"},{"number":"980065","threadNumber":"980053","comment":"<a href=\"#p980053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;980053</a><br><br>“<span class=\"mu-i\">You’ve</span> secured peace?” You shoot her an incredulous look.<br><br>“Averron at large now knows the consequences of player-versus-player combat.

I wanted to partake. But as you’ve seen yourself, it’s not a matter of merit to do so – merely luck and proper connections. And I was downtrodden by the Crimson Guardians and their hegemony; I wasn’t <span class=\"mu-i\">right</span> for them, allegedly. So I had no place to call my own, a fate I wouldn’t wish on anyone.”<br><br>“Then?”<br><br>“He saw my potential.” She says, giving you a flat look. “Of course, I didn’t disappoint. I became his second in command – discerned the method behind his madness – and when he quit, no one was more suited to take the helm.”<br><br>“Your guild widened the gap between Nameless and Identified.” You shoot her a bit of a glare. “You’re right that I’m not a fan of the Alliance’s methods, but I’m hoping to get us all to work together in the interest of unity – which I have a feeling is going to be very important with us coming into contact with more cities.”<br><br>“Our actions have always been in the interest of equality, Ascheritte. Though some choose to look down upon us for playing by the rules that this game has already set in place.” She says, extending a hand to help you up the next set of rocks; you accept, though mentally double-checking to ensure it’s her right hand. “We are leaders, you know, but some in Averron are not content with mere leadership. They are not interested in creating unity,” Freya continues, “They are interested in deciding what unity represents.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1482887157000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/27/16(Tue)20:05","id":"XrT+CxR1","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Anaximander.jpg","fileSize":"282178 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/980053/images/1482887157935.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/980053/thumbs/1482887157935s.jpg","md5":"SPUqqmKAN5IigJZRaJAKYQ==","w":"590","h":"900","tn_w":"81","tn_h":"125"},{"number":"980551","threadNumber":"980053","comment":"<a href=\"#p980533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;980533</a><br><br>Your UI pings.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Nel ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Nel ]]: Hey Ashe!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Nel ]]: It’s really quiet in Averron what’s going on</span><br><br>You cross over the lip of the cliff face, unsteady on your feet – though much more than in your dealing with cursed boots.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Underground: Lower Averron – Tethiss’s Claw // PVP Enabled ]]</span><br><br>It’s quiet here.
