A brief quiet falls over the room; only the heartbeat of the technology surrounding you can be heard before she continues. “Do you know of a guild called Freakshow, or of a man named Anaximander?”<br><br>“Yes, in fact.” The Queen smiles. “Someone by that name was in my court not too long ago. An interesting one, assuming we’re speaking of the same man: very forward-thinking, with a number of ideas I can only call peculiar. Whether or not I agree with any of them, I’m still mulling over, but…”<br><br>“Listen to me carefully: he cannot be trusted at any cost.” Liza hisses, pushing her way past you and Kainzo to take center stage before the projector screen. “I need to know what he told you.”<br><br>“You are Liza, of the Crimson Guardians?” Hecatel asks. “I was given specific instruction not to tell you.”<br><br>“Consider this, Hecatel. If you choose to make him your ally, I won’t be held responsible for my actions.” She’s having trouble keeping herself under control; her hands are balled into tight fists, and you think you can hear Crimson Wings beginning to warm up. “The rest of my Alliance will fall in behind me—even if you really are royalty.”","time":1451692860000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/1/16(Fri)19:01","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 19 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1422324183059.jpg","fileSize":"396742 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/44507775/images/1451692860225.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/44507775/thumbs/1451692860225s.jpg","md5":"B3CpLdGgSXetSZAyFpGzeA==","w":"679","h":"1549","tn_w":"109","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"44507799","threadNumber":"44507775","comment":"<a href=\"#p44507775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44507775</a><br><br>“Relax, girl.” The Queen shrugs her off. “Perhaps you might better persuade me in person to break my little oath with him. But if you believe you’re going to do it by force, you are sadly mistaken. Now, Averron: as we speak, my Regent is at work organizing maps, blueprints, and other relevant information that might be of use to you.

The message boards are back online—that means watch them. I’m calling for a meeting soon, to discuss the upcoming merger, and the question of our foreign policy.”<br><br>“Great,” Andor says. “Sven will be happy to hear it, and I’m sure the rest of our officers will too.

Areas of note have been classified as dungeons (ruins or areas with boss spawns, altars, or other notable properties), hunting grounds (large, typically open areas with high monster or resource spawn rates that are “safer” due to high player density), and unexplored branches, many of the closest of which are likely being mapped presently.<br><br>It also looks like someone’s started a “bounty hunting” thread that’s gotten a number of replies.

There’s the upper platforms near Averron, where crawlers and boss varieties thereof occasionally spawn. Packed with people, probably, but with a number of offshoot caves where you imagine you could find herbs or resources if you were interested in such a thing.<br><br>The cave where you, Aelriss, and Tatsumaki encountered the frog boss was cleared out not too long ago, and now serves as a hunting ground for more of the oversized insects. The part you didn’t get to, however, is an only-partly-mapped dungeon area full of the things: a proper hive, as it were. It’s not known how deep it goes, but save for the “sliverwing queen”, presented with a cross-posted bestiary entry, there haven’t been too many new discoveries in the mapped area.<br><br>An underground lake in a branch a distance straight below the outside of the ex-Sanctum appears to be home to rare aquatic creatures: primarily water skirters and lake sprites, as well as some rumored rare spawns that haven’t been documented, leading some to believe they aren’t actually real. Further down, the first open magma branch was discovered a while back, and hasn’t been explored thoroughly save for the adjacent locations populated with aethersteel and elemental beasts.<br><br>The deepest documented area is the Araneid nest, far below. The creatures encountered there have been the source of a number of more exotic weapons and materials, and the associated lore suggests the presence of a very powerful NPC somewhere in the unexplored part of the area—likely a Precursor.","time":1451710069000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/1/16(Fri)23:47","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"},{"isOp":false,"number":"44513922","threadNumber":"44507775","comment":"<a href=\"#p44513896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44513896</a><br>“What’s going on here?” You ask.
