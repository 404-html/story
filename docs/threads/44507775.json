A brief quiet falls over the room; only the heartbeat of the technology surrounding you can be heard before she continues. “Do you know of a guild called Freakshow, or of a man named Anaximander?”<br><br>“Yes, in fact.” The Queen smiles. “Someone by that name was in my court not too long ago. An interesting one, assuming we’re speaking of the same man: very forward-thinking, with a number of ideas I can only call peculiar. Whether or not I agree with any of them, I’m still mulling over, but…”<br><br>“Listen to me carefully: he cannot be trusted at any cost.” Liza hisses, pushing her way past you and Kainzo to take center stage before the projector screen. “I need to know what he told you.”<br><br>“You are Liza, of the Crimson Guardians?” Hecatel asks. “I was given specific instruction not to tell you.”<br><br>“Consider this, Hecatel. If you choose to make him your ally, I won’t be held responsible for my actions.” She’s having trouble keeping herself under control; her hands are balled into tight fists, and you think you can hear Crimson Wings beginning to warm up. “The rest of my Alliance will fall in behind me—even if you really are royalty.”","filename":"1422324183059.jpg","fileSize":"387 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44507775/images/1451692860225.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44507775/images/1451692860225s.jpg","md5":"B3CpLdGgSXetSZAyFpGzeA==","w":679,"h":1549,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":250},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":44507775,"number":44507799,"name":"BSO","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","time":1451692939000,"time4chanFormatted":"01/01/16(Fri)19:02:19","comment":"<a href=\"#p44507775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44507775</a><br><br>“Relax, girl.” The Queen shrugs her off. “Perhaps you might better persuade me in person to break my little oath with him. But if you believe you’re going to do it by force, you are sadly mistaken. Now, Averron: as we speak, my Regent is at work organizing maps, blueprints, and other relevant information that might be of use to you. We’ll be in touch in the coming days—once your Guardian has had time to cool off—should you desire to make contact so we might begin our journey to the surface together.

She pauses, then addresses Andor and Ayla. “I think it’s important that we finalize the Alliance merger before we put the excavation plans back into motion. The message boards are back online—that means watch them. I’m calling for a meeting soon, to discuss the upcoming merger, and the question of our foreign policy.”<br><br>“Great,” Andor says. “Sven will be happy to hear it, and I’m sure the rest of our officers will too.

A woman—you recognize her as the one who put the enchantment on your sword in town—is just finishing off her opponent, another player, who hits the wall trailing smoke and flames.
