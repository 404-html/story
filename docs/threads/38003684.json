The five of you are lurking in the corner of a cave about halfway between Averron City and the lower branches; Aelriss and Donnel joined your party not too long ago, replacing Ayla, who went to join the Alliance leaders, and Vision, who since logged out. Allegedly, the Nameless have been incited into a riot which is currently underway in Averron City; you and your party, along with the remaining members of Aelriss and Donnel's party, were forced to fight off about a dozen Nameless immediately outside the ruins, and are now in search of something else to do.<br><br>The cave you've settled in is a little out of the way, though occasionally crawlers pop up from the ground nearby.

There's what looks like a skirmish underway up ahead, with the ranks of the Averron Guard broken by a group of Nameless. Three guardsmen stand a ways apart from one another, looking for an approach angle on the group of four Nameless they're surrounding.<br><br>The Nameless, though, are set on other targets. They're engaged in combat with an absolutely massive, greataxe-wielding man--you think he maxed his avatar's dimensions--wearing red-trimmed armor, marked with a familiar logo. Crimson Guard. They're lashing in and out like the sisters with chromatic hair you fought earlier, taking turns to keep the adjacent guardsmen at bay.<br><br>They're chipping away at the Crimson's armor. It seems like they're too fast for him; then, he twirls his axe overhead and levels it in a wide, barreling maneuver that cleaves through a member of the Nameless group, shoulder to waist. He spins, spiked shield ready, and takes a hit to the back that doesn't seem to bother him. Rather than block the next attack, he bashes the next Nameless with his shield, immobilizing him for long enough for the Crimson to essentially fall on him, shield forward, planting the spike through his chest.<br><br>He rolls aside to dodge a blow from behind, and the members of the Guard move in to finish off the third kill before helping the Crimson to his feet. The four of them begin to make their way into the city, with you following cautiously a ways behind them.
