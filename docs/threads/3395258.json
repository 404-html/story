[{"isOp":true,"number":3395258,"threadNumber":0,"comment":"When contemporary computing hardware standards – small-motion eye tracking, electroencephalography, and sensory complex neural dive – first made it to market, so many were enamored by the implications. Simulation technology was practically designed, for example, to revolutionize engineering, architecture, and digital art; the consequences it held for computational neurology were nothing short of incredible, and the potential it opened for disabled individuals to access fields previously inaccessible to them could not be understated. Applying such technology to an end of vapid entertainment and puerile escapism was thought of by pioneers as an insulting waste of potential; because this new technology was, at the time, so prohibitively expensive as to be only accessible to industry professionals, the idea of using it for gaming remained strictly within the enthusiast sphere.<br><br>Now, years later, the technology is everywhere. Many individuals wear glasses-rigs in everyday life, linking wirelessly to smartphones to project augmented-reality interfaces that obviate the difficulties of modern infrastructure’s complexity. You can navigate unfamiliar cities with a heads-up display that warns of traffic or inclement weather, or complete monetary transactions with the literal blink of an eye. And even though the levels of technology once only available to large top-end setups have proliferated through the consumer-grade market, the principle of virtual-reality gaming remains thoroughly enthusiast if only in the sheer indulgence of it. The idea of immersing oneself in an virtual world of anonymity and adventuresome luxury, that responds to want by shortcutting the brain’s capacity for reward, would once have been considered a danger to society rather than a dream come true.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1554056610000,"time4chanFormatted":"03/31/19(Sun)14:23:30","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 33 ]]","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"1427157837862.jpg","fileSize":"76322 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554056610077.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554056610077s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":738,"h":1200,"tn_w":153,"tn_h":250},{"number":3395261,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<a href=\"#p3395258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3395258</a><br><br>For you, in many aspects, it is a dream come true. You find there is a certain romance to the immediacy and spontaneity of the virtual world you indulge in. Or, at least, you’ve convinced yourself of this because the alternative is to think of yourself as a filthy addict. With a sigh, you lean back in your office chair and let your eyes flutter momentarily closed, thinking of what all’s on your agenda. In real-space, you’ve got some shopping to do – both for groceries and for some actual furniture for the new place. There’s Grayson’s wedding, too, this upcoming weekend; you wince and poke out your tongue in an expression of momentary distaste. Feels like all of your friends are getting married off and leaving you behind, now. With a little bit of a huff, you reach down to grab another bite of the cake donut on your desk. There’s powdered sugar on your fingers; semisolid lemon-jelly crumbs fall onto your jean shorts, thankfully missing your plaid woolen shirt and dusting the tank top beneath. Maybe you are addicted to something.<br><br>Ah, well.<br><br>You’ve got other friends, anyway, for as much as they’re worth – or at least, you might, because it feels like someone’s conspiring to take them away from you, too. Connected to you strictly through the digital frontier, they’re the kind your grandparents would argue don’t count as real friends, but that’s hardly the point. Just a small amount of time to clear your head of emotions and thoughts of urgent, addictive necessity, has given you a clear course of action as far as what to do in simulation-space. You’ve decided it’s probably best to abdicate your position entirely. The Averron Alliance doesn’t need you, particularly; your technological understanding will eventually be replaced or replicated by someone else, and along other avenues, Ascheritte is undeniably stronger and an overall better player than you are. Even if he is a decidedly poor strategist, he’ll make a superior leader and cause less drama among the guilds by simply being. And as for the Writ Keepers? Dorian, your second-in-command and sole officer, seems either to care about your guild more than you do, or to covet your position as a leader more than you care about your guild. Under his command, you imagine, the Keepers will thrive.<br><br>It’s a shame you probably won’t make it back to facilitate the clean transfer of power.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1554056673000,"time4chanFormatted":"03/31/19(Sun)14:24:33","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"84129481.jpg","fileSize":"94197 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554056673834.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554056673834s.jpg","md5":"IWAIpQfpGzEg/bsCbfrX2A==","w":1023,"h":653,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79},{"number":3395264,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<a href=\"#p3395261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3395261</a><br><br>Mind wandering, you minimize the windows on your work desktop and stray briefly over to the imageboards.

In a fair game, dragons have attack patterns; they claw, bite, and tail-whip in predictable sequences, and after circling in the air for a time using breath attacks, they land to fight on your terms. But Broken Sky Online is not a fair game. You, exemplifying the relentless power of Strife Memoriam, are a fine example. Explosive fireballs buffet the floor around you as you dodge toward the wall of the molten fortress ahead. Your claws dig into the stone surface, and you launch yourself upward with a series of grappling leaps, light-leaking eyes fixated on the scaled foe circling overhead. You have reached the top, and can climb no further, but…<br><br>…with a final powerful leap, you launch yourself skyward. The dragon roars, a cone of flame erupting from its mouth to consume you entirely, aiming to burn you to cinders before you can reach your target; you spin, putting your moltensteel bulwark forward, and feel yourself wincing, teeth gritting, as you push into the flames. And when it subsides, you see the glint in a reptilian eye as you reach backward with your other hand and pull a Celestial sword from the lingering darkness. You wield the Exile’s blade, a paradox of light and shadow, a bar of gleaming white flame cast in crackling bilateral darkness, and you swing it with furious purpose. It collides squarely with your foe, turning its continued roar into a pained shriek as the ensuing black explosion blooms outward, consuming the two of you in the cold fire.","time":1554063739000,"time4chanFormatted":"03/31/19(Sun)16:22:19","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"3462476335.jpg","fileSize":"171253 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554063739928.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554063739928s.jpg","md5":"8FpCYrFUSGM47QW1PKcaaw==","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125},{"number":3395531,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<a href=\"#p3395520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3395520</a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ HP: 23 / 35 ]]</span><br><br>The dragon’s claw catches you.

You would drink the veins of a God dry for more power. <br><br>You shake your head to clear away the invasive thoughts, bracing your shield against any further incoming attacks. Your foe is powerful, but its purpose is singular: to strike by claw and by flame. These attacks are predictable, but only just; the dragon’s speed and sheer aggression, still, render it a force to be reckoned with. That, and the fact that it isn’t dead yet. But that’s no matter; if it wasn’t felled by the previous barrage, a second strike from your Celestial sword will surely end it.<br><br>“Tatsumaki! Gimme some space, girl!” Vyx is hard to hear in the echoing noise of the place, speaking over incessant handcannon staccato. You can’t imagine being on the receiving end of that barrage, under which even a dragon seems to wither. Her firepower is impressive; though you aren’t aware of how much damage each successful impact inflicts on its scales and the tattered webbing of its wings, you imagine it is as if drowning in a tide of metal. You know your shield can protect from individual fireballs, and so interpose yourself between Vyx and the beast, stone shifting beneath your heels as you intercept each one.<br><br>Tatsumaki either doesn’t hear or doesn’t understand the verbal command. You’ve moved ahead, but she darts past you and veers abruptly to the side, drawing the creature’s attention away. Attacking from ambush seemed more successful than any other plan, though; here, all it takes is a swipe of the wing to send her flying into the air and bouncing across the stones. Even with your damage resistance, this foe hits like few others have; a strike like those the two of you have fielded would likely kill Nel or Cornelius outright, which makes them understandably hesitant to engage in close combat.<br><br>It’s unlikely that you’d be able to pin this creature down like you once did the Obsidian Pegasus; the Last Argument, while a strong weapon in its own right, is unlikely to sink into the environmental stone.

A look over your shoulder reveals her cartwheeling away; luckily, the drake’s attention remains focused on you.

You drop to all fours, the wings of the Pegasus still bright behind you.

The transition is difficult; the lingering effect of your Pegasus cuirass wants your body to resist changes in its motion, but the Exile’s uncanny ability to circumvent modifiers to your movement causes you to simply clamber upward the stone face – iron nails digging in – at a speed that makes you appear truly horrifying from outside. The dragon reaches the apex of its height, and from across the molten hall, you see Vyx lock-on and fire, measured barrage of rounds buffeting the creature with explosive force on impact. You launch yourself from the wall, sailing toward the beast...<br><br>It recovers mid-air and <span class=\"mu-i\">roars</span>. But its presence cannot frighten you in your state, and through the immense pressure it exerts, the Pegasus abides. The Celestial sword emerges in a black flash, and you cast it down; an explosion bathes the room in darkness, carpet of shadow rushing away from beneath the point of impact and crawling upward the walls to vanish in the corners of the place. Stones break from the ceiling, shattering on the floor and exposing magma beneath. The dragon is sent spiraling downward, crashing in the middle of the floor; the Exile’s armor breaks and melts around you as you spin and fly backwards, sending trails of oily droplets splattering in all directions.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ HP: 14 / 35 ]]</span><br><br>As you crash to the ground in a puddle, your increased fire resistance promptly fades with the consumption of Cornelius’s focus for a final effort. Over your head, contrasting shadow with brightness, you see the power of pure ice rendered as a beam of blue light that pierces your foe. The air is hot and dry, but from here you can feel the cold of it and hear a strange crackling over the creature’s weakening cries. Its movement slows, light in its eyes burning out. It meets your gaze as a statue rimed with frost.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ young earthcrowned drake was defeated. ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ You have 1 unspent EXP. ]]</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1554107020000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/01/19(Mon)04:23:40","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"Nel.jpg","fileSize":"112367 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554107020102.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554107020102s.jpg","md5":"5Prjuts30sNcwYhBrsfIyg==","w":987,"h":1695,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125},{"number":3397640,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<s>Will likely be updating intermittently tomorrow.

I’d still like to hang on to it, though.” You respond. “I play close to the Alliance, so anything that develops from the former isn’t gonna be a surprise to you guys at all.”<br><br>“More than reasonable, given your contribution to the fight.” Cornelius says.<br><br>“Awh. I was hoping I could keep it…” Nel frowns. “I guess we’ll be able to craft a couple of armor pieces, at least.”<br><br>“I’d hate to be insistent, but I plan to take one of these Gems. It will more than compensate for my loss today.” Cornelius adds. “As for the others—I would suggest Ascheritte receive the foremost, while Vyx and Tatsumaki each contributed a fair amount of damage and utility…”<br><br>“You wouldn’t even have been able to get up to that ledge without me!” Nel folds his arms. “Your damage should count for me too!”<br><br>“Oh, just give mine to him if y’all are gonna start an argument.” Vyx rolls her eyes, leering momentarily at the alluring glint of the jewels. “Just remember you owe me a big time cut-in.”<br><br>“Hang on,” You suggest. If you back out of a Gem, you’ll be able to get an extra unique item, or just the lion’s share of the crafting materials. It would *hurt* you to do so… but you’ll need upgrades if you plan to continue your pursuit. “I… might back out myself, if it means I could get more of something else. If there’s more Gems on the altar we can see how many we have before deciding.”<br><br>“Ascheritte’s suggestion makes the most sense. The bulk crafting resources aren’t in even amounts – so some of us will have to take less of some materials and more of others. We can distribute them when we’re done, and if you’d like to trade we can sort it out when we’re in a safe spot.”<br><br>Idly, you inspect the body. The earthcrowned prophet’s regalia is a layered scarlet cloth robe; though the material is sheer, it appears quite durable. Golden trim is delicately sewn in in patterns depicting the heads of dragons. Myriad chains with small golden necklaces covered in charms hang and arc between the layers of cloth.<br><br>“There are five items outside of the bulk materials – two claws, this robe, the cryst, and the egg. Does anyone want a dragon’s claw more than anything else?” Cornelius asks.<br><br>“Me.” Vyx says. “You still owe me though.”<br><br>“Okay, that makes that easier.” He makes his way to the top of the stairs – and shudders visibly, leaning in to inspect the altar. You follow after him, stopping at the sight of the breathtaking spectacle. “Friends? We could become a new world power with this, you realize.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1554165752000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/01/19(Mon)20:42:32","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"2141829515.jpg","fileSize":"26773 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554165752361.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554165752361s.jpg","md5":"h4q1PAJo/v7g79g5HGXH/g==","w":490,"h":368,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93},{"number":3399585,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<a href=\"#p3399576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3399576</a><br><br>Carved from a single tablet of obsidian, this statue depicts a woman who genuflects before an everlasting fire, individual folds of the fabric of her clothing affected in flawless stone.

Liza and the Disposable Heroes’ upcoming investment could build an Advent Gate, but the first one is most likely to connect Averron City to the Observatory—and right now, that would just leave you worse off.

The pulse of combat echoes outward from the beat of a single footstep.<br><br>The girl shoulders her rifle, and you dart forward toward the Observatory, launching yourself into a dive-roll that carries you beneath the salvo of caster bolts that give way to flashes of white light against the distant cavern wall. You hit the ground, skidding, and draw the Last Argument in preparation to defend yourself. The martial artist, unusually, looks like he’s trying to create some distance and block off your escape; closer to you is the swordsman, who’s immediately in front of you when you recover clumsily from the roll, driving his sword towards your chest.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Underground: Averron Observatory // Neutral Territory // PVP Disabled ]]</span><br><br>The tip of the blade glints off of you in a shower of blue sparks, a grid of hard-light unfolding immediately beneath it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1554262303000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/02/19(Tue)23:31:43","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"Crow.jpg","fileSize":"90656 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554262303389.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554262303389s.jpg","md5":"htWnLu+5NTOKR7gYYOZwyQ==","w":500,"h":810,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125},{"number":3403005,"threadNumber":3395258,"comment":"<a href=\"#p3402996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3402996</a><br><br>“Damn.” The swordsman says, looking down with a grin. “Almost had him.

You find yourself suddenly photosensitive as you reacclimate, and the image you see is half-distorted in time, afterimages of your hands trailing behind their place in your vision.

There, an arrangement of transgressors is held, kneeling, at the spearpoints of royal guards. Some are petty criminals; others are heretics, adherents to the First Artificer’s forbidden teachings.

Still, he is possessed of a divine heritage that makes him a figure of unparalleled might. It is by his grace that you stand here today; it is by his gift that you stand a leader in the court. The golden cord you wear on your shoulder, hemmed in scarlet-colored metal, is the sign of your position at his right hand.<br><br>“Forgiveness was once the way of our court, but forgiveness, you see—has afforded us only sorrow. It has entombed our once-great kingdom beneath the earth, where the sun’s light will never again shine upon it. Now, great Lieutenant.” He says, and you feel his strength reverberate with the sound of his voice and the sudden presence of his hand on your shoulder. In your brief glimpse of acknowledgement, you see a spark of black fire behind his eyes. “We must be strong of will, such that we do not sink deeper into this abyss. Your time has come.

Her armored helmet materializes from a blue scan-line with a mechanical chirping, visor clicking into place. The lift generated is enough to drag her to her feet and beyond, recovering from the forced prostration into a levitating, cautious stance.

The distance closed is closed in an instant, the flat of her spear brought around to collide with your side. It strikes you with a resonant clang, and you feel the reverberation of it through your armor as the weapon slams against your body through your unscathed cloak.

There’s another clash as it collides with her armored forearms, sparking midway down its length; you hear her grunt in discomfort or exertion. But she stays the course, honing half of your blade with her armored gauntlets in ducking low, pressing in, and grabbing you by your arm and shoulder. You won’t let her move you…<br><br>There’s the sound of engines again. She swings you off of the ground full-circle into a jet-assisted spin, fanning her wings and blasting forward from one pair.

Foremost is your Celestial Artifact. Florica warns me that it allows you to internalize the powers of your enemies. Our foes are growing more powerful, and her warnings of these Observers have become more pronounced. Her concern is that you may succumb to some manner of internal turmoil contending with these diverse powers. Mine is that they will change you. We know of great corruptive influences within this game. Should you conquer one I have no assurance it will not turn you against us.” Liza says, folding her arms. “Next is the magnitude of this power. The effect you just projected was able to hit players outside of the PVP zone, which may be a call to us to reassess our policies and the defensive measures we put into place to ensure that players do not harm one another or come to do so accidentally.”<br><br>You nod. “Is that all?”<br><br>“Last concerns the repercussions. If you’re sure you are presently in control, I put my trust in you to handle the situation with Tethiss’s Claw and the bounty placed upon you. The moment you are done, I implore you—either join a guild, or start one of your own.”<br><br>“This again?” You ask.<br><br>“Not everything is about you.” Liza folds her arms. “Other unaffiliated players are growing dangerously influential.

We believe that Kengo’s sword—the Calamity Blade ‘Ruin’—holds the potential to destroy Celestial objects, but she’s neglected to comment on any such property.”<br><br>“Calamity, huh?” You ask. “Has Florica ever mentioned any kind of Calamity to you outside of that?”<br><br>“Briefly.

I’d like to be more generous than that, but until I’ve brought them into the fold for certain—and I am trying—then I can’t be entirely certain. I can’t imagine their agenda is outright malicious, but it is mercenary; their potential, too, is almost necessary for us to venture further downward than we have yet at present.
