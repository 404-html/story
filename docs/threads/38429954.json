The district is quiet, so you elect to wait outside, watching the hall from a nearby alley It's at least a few minutes before anything happens: then, you see the doors open, and a crowd of people emerges. You recognize Andor, from the Disposable Heroes, mid-debate with a hooded woman who walks at his side.

It's troubling. Do you know how far he can reach?” She asks.<br><br>“Far.” You respond. “I'm not sure what the limit is, or if he even has one. My party and I have been concerned, as he appears to be using it to orchestrate ambush groups.”<br><br>“We discussed the possibility.” Ayla responds. “The Guardians are fixated on driving Freakshow out of Averron, but we've elected not to move until we've reached a consensus.
