She's starting to think about her words, and sounds overall more severe; you think she might be slipping back into character. News of your actions has spread impressively far; you've barely spent any time in Averron, and you've already “You weren't there when that was going on, by chance? I'd like to hear someone else's side of the story...”<br><br>“Yeah, I was there.” You say. “Actually, that was me.”<br><br>She looks dumbfounded, and you continue.<br><br>“I found out you could offer the Unique Identifiers of dead players to the statue.” You suggest, folding your arms and leaning against a derelict market stall. “I'm surprised no one's tried it yet.”<br><br>“People have been hoarding them,” she replies, “In hopes of finding a way to resurrect the dead, or a way to break them down for materials. We're not sure what they're made of—but we might be able to cannibalize them for more impressive technology, upgrade them, or even replicate them, as a way of bringing new players into the game.”<br><br>“Well, my friend and I offered some we came across on a rogue Nameless, and they disappeared.

It's easy to throw her off—when she gets serious, she's used to expecting everyone around her to do the same. “The Heroes are laid-back, but there's not a whole lot of leadership among them. Andor's been enforcing the neutrality policy around town, whereas the rest of the officers are pushing recruits toward the surface project.
