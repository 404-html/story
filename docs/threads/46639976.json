It’s like the fate of the world rests in our hands.”<br><br>“Do you guys ever shut up?” Ayla says, penning something in her UI. “I’ll be celebrating the day everyone in your guild gets over themselves.”<br><br>“Chill, girl.” Mendicant raises an eyebrow. “Florica’s gone, you know—and she’s not all that bad once you get to know her. I think the two of you just got off on the wrong foot.”<br><br>“Been a while since I’ve heard more of an understatement.” Sven says. “In my opinion, everyone involved in this whole needs to chill a little.

Not only are they aggressive to us, they are aggressive to everything else too. They're destroying camping gorunds, trapping farming spots, and spreading even farther. If they keep coming they'll press into the safe zones. I short they are a massive threat to everyone. These guy are coming from a damaged seal deep in the Earth. So we need to come together, clear the grounds and find it so we can fix it and put them back in their box. Now I know what you're thinking, \"what's in it for me?\" Well besides the return of local farming and camping grounds, you get secuirirty, no more enemies bushwhacking you from surprise, you get loot, these guys are unique, and instanced event the can have decent items. You'll get experience, they are lots of these guys, and they're worth a decent chunk of exp, and then you'll get prestige.
