The two of you stand on the edge of a rocky plateau; another large plateau, hidden from below, protrudes outward about twenty feet below you. Carved into the rock face, downward and a distance away, you can see a tiny home, with a carefully crafted doorway and window, darkness within. Between you and that house, though, there’s a pair of lava striders: skinless, long-legged, magma-borne insectoids that wander around and cling to hot cavern walls. “We could probably sneak by those creatures if we hug the cavern wall.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>","filename":"1422324183059.jpg","fileSize":"387 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/45965808/images/1457819473828.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/45965808/images/1457819473828s.jpg","md5":"B3CpLdGgSXetSZAyFpGzeA==","w":679,"h":1549,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":250},{"isOp":false,"threadNumber":45965808,"number":45965821,"name":"Sylvetica","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","time":1457819519000,"time4chanFormatted":"03/12/16(Sat)16:51:59","comment":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Fan Works: Artifact Ideas ]]</span><br>https://titanpad.com/kZOMVYSrMv<br><br>“I can’t imagine what treasure would be hidden in a place like this.” Cardus says.

Tatsumaki leans down to pick up a large piece, looking to you for approval; you nod, and follow suit, carefully grabbing another bit of rock. Together, you throw the pieces a distance, and they land on the plateau far past the lava striders, which, as predicted, turn to investigate.<br><br>You use this chance to sneak further ahead, making your way to the tiny home. The windows and doorway are softly carved, as if either worked with incredible finesse or shaped while the stone was still partially melted. First, a cursory glance through the windows—it’s somewhat dark, but you still see nothing, so the two of you carefully enter, you in the lead.<br><br>There’s a hiss and a crack from behind you – the sound of Tatsumaki lighting a fluorescent torch – and the darkness fades away. A table and chair, primitive furniture of similar stonecraft, sit on one end of the room, just a foot or so off the wall, hiding the corner from view. There’s a set of cracks in the floor that give an unusual impression of depth; a mineral vein, or perhaps something hidden below?<br><br>What catches your eye and Tatsumaki’s, though, is the back wall of the tiny room. There’s a large rune carved into the stone: concentric circles, with thick lines leading outward from the center of it all, connecting the many rings to form a strange sort of network. It looks like the plan for a city, all roads leading inward to or outward from one place.

The timepiece would augment our current approach to fights and the game itself outside of fights. The totem would potentially upend our fighting style depending on what it could actually do and as far as I understand we'd end up spending a lot of time outside combat devoted to chasing down new and more powerful spirits. I can't help but suspect that would in turn involve a lot of backplot and so on due to the nature of this game and I fear it would detract from the /important/ backplot - that which relates to precursors and everyone's bid for the surface.<br><br>It just feels to me like there would be overall too much distraction from what this quest currently is.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;timepiece is MORE exotic than the paintbrush</span><br>Sorry, poor choice of word I guess.
