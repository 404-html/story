The two of you stand on the edge of a rocky plateau; another large plateau, hidden from below, protrudes outward about twenty feet below you. Carved into the rock face, downward and a distance away, you can see a tiny home, with a carefully crafted doorway and window, darkness within. Between you and that house, though, there’s a pair of lava striders: skinless, long-legged, magma-borne insectoids that wander around and cling to hot cavern walls. “We could probably sneak by those creatures if we hug the cavern wall.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1457819473000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/12/16(Sat)16:51","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 21 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1422324183059.jpg","fileSize":"396742 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45965808/images/1457819473828.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/45965808/thumbs/1457819473828s.jpg","md5":"B3CpLdGgSXetSZAyFpGzeA==","w":"679","h":"1549","tn_w":"109","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"45965821","threadNumber":"45965808","comment":"<span class=\"quote\">> [[ Fan Works: Artifact Ideas ]]</span><br>https://titanpad.com/kZOMVYSrMv<br><br>“I can’t imagine what treasure would be hidden in a place like this.” Cardus says.
