You're meandering about outside the halls, and walk onto the edge of the steps, as it's the closest one. It's somewhere between barracks and castle, with a red roof and numerous flags emblazoned with the crimson insignia. You pause, taking a look at the plaque nearby the door.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Crimson Guardians – Guild Hall ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Guild Leader: Liza ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Guild Officers: Kainzo, Mendicant, Florica ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ “ Glory Is Forever ” ]]</span><br><br>You contemplate knocking.<br><br>Though, you were meaning to pay the Writ Keepers a visit as well. You were planning on waiting for Ayla, though she presented the option of speaking to Dorian, presumably one of her officers; the notion doesn't sound terribly appealing to you, as what you were planning on talking about pertained, at least somewhat, to her. At the top of the steps to the Guardians' hall, you turn on a heel to head that way. A couple of familiar figures intercept your path, however.<br><br>“Ascheritte.” Aelriss waves. The collar of a chain shirt is visible, under the neck of her cloak. Tatsumaki is following close behind; she's wearing a pair of scale gauntlets right now that give off a faint glow of a hazy golden brown. “There you are. What are you doing?”<br><br>“Just checking out the guild halls.” You respond. “I heard there was some fighting going on over here, and I was thinking about joining up with a guild anyway.”<br><br>“Mm, you were talking to Liza back there, I heard. The Guardians, right?” She sticks her tongue out, screwing up her face for a second at the notion. “Bleh.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued... ]]</span>","time":1424481361000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/20/15(Fri)20:16","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":"[[ Broken Sky Online Quest - Session 9 ]]","trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"0b0c7a43c9ee119ff3e5b863d2ef0d42475e9524.jpg","fileSize":"88614 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38202767/images/1424481361864.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38202767/thumbs/1424481361864s.jpg","md5":"6m5x1cRfjQHxAgmvj3mv4A==","w":"738","h":"1200","tn_w":"153","tn_h":"250"},{"isOp":false,"number":"38202832","threadNumber":"38202767","comment":"<a href=\"#p38202767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;38202767</a><br><br>“Mm, you were talking to Liza back there, I heard.

You're not disinterested: rather, you're still conflicted. Liza's \"deception\" has left your thoughts of the Alliance a bit fuzzy.<br><br>“Mhm. I dunno, I guess I'm just not as hardcore as them. It doesn't sound so appealing to me.” Aelriss shrugs. “I actually wanted to see if the Writ Keepers would take me.”<br><br>“Really?” You grin.<br><br>“Yeah,” She responds. “Don't get me wrong. I'm not much of a roleplayer. It just sounds fun, y'know?”<br><br>“It's alright. You'd like it.” You respond, making your way to the bottom of the stairs to lean against the nearby pillar. Dressing in weapons and armor is still just tiring enough to feel real. You should get back to hunting Celestial Gems soon. “Ayla's really cool.”<br><br>“She seemed like it. God, the top guild officers must feel like celebrities.” Aelriss says. “You think you could have done what the Alliance leaders did, if you'd gotten to Averron first?”<br><br>“Maybe.” You respond. “I doubt it's completely luck, if that's what you're asking. I'm not saying I couldn't, but some of them are pretty good. I'm sure Liza is, anyway, and Ayla treats this game like it's rocket science. It's crazy.”<br><br>Aelriss nods, looking a bit despondent.<br><br>“Really?” You ask. “That upsets you? You know you've got one of the only Celestial Artifacts in the game, right? And a fucking strong one, to boot. Go wave that around and see how many people stick to you.”<br><br>“Oh, please.” She chuckles. “Go on.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1424481547000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/20/15(Fri)20:19","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Aelriss.jpg","fileSize":"132820 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38202767/images/1424481547645.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38202767/thumbs/1424481547645s.jpg","md5":"w73UsJub4uJHjQ+fYu2FWA==","w":"1000","h":"605","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"75"},{"isOp":false,"number":"38202880","threadNumber":"38202767","comment":"<a href=\"#p38202832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;38202832</a><br><br>\"I see.
