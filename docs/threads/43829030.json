Vaine merely breathes a sigh of relief, and you see Pandora rushing to your side.<br><br>“What happened?” From elsewhere, you hear Troja's voice.<br><br>“I'm not sure.” You say, coming to your senses, a bit shaken. “I disconnected, for sure.

With a relieved sigh of your own, you continue. “...Did I miss anything?”<br><br>“Not at all.” Pandora says. “We haven't divvied up the loot from the Chthonic yet. If you're still interested in material pleasures after a stunt like that, anyway...”<br><br>“Yeah, sure.

But thanks. I owe you.” A brief silence, as you go over your inventory again. Could this guy be with Nephilim? He doesn't look like anyone you've seen; and why would he save you, if he was? “You said you're a traveler? Where from?”<br><br>“To be quite honest, many locales. But most recently, the lands below. Through unfortunate circumstances, I found myself deep beneath the earth, far from my starting zone, and was borne upwards given the barest hints at civilization.” He smiles, pointing to his UI. “I barely managed to make it here, and now... well, my next destination is called Hecatelia. Do you know of it?\"<br><br>“Yeah,” Troja says. “It's the nearest town.”<br><br>“I think we're pretty far along in the progression of things, too.” Vaine says. “Our top guilds are headed for the surface now.”<br><br>“Oh, that's good!
