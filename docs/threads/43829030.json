You have time to move freely while you can still see the back half of its body above ground, and you utilize it as best you can, scrambling up the side of the maw back toward the crumbling terrace, now high overhead.

The cavern around you is made of sparkling crystals like bismuth. You look up. You're half-sitting, half-lying on the floor, with Vaine sort-of awkwardly cradling your torso.<br><br>“Sybil's alright.” Cecily says, sitting nearby. Vaine merely breathes a sigh of relief, and you see Pandora rushing to your side.<br><br>“What happened?” From elsewhere, you hear Troja's voice.<br><br>“I'm not sure.” You say, coming to your senses, a bit shaken. “I disconnected, for sure. Dozed off, maybe? Had a weird dream.”<br><br>At that, you check your inventory. Sure enough, the Gem is there. With a relieved sigh of your own, you continue. “...Did I miss anything?”<br><br>“Not at all.” Pandora says. “We haven't divvied up the loot from the Chthonic yet. If you're still interested in material pleasures after a stunt like that, anyway...”<br><br>“Yeah, sure. I'm in.” You shake your head. “Thanks for the assist, guys.”<br><br>“Don't thank us, actually.” Cecily says.<br><br>“Yeah,” Troja adds. “Thank this guy.”<br><br>You look over, to see her sitting nearby a campfire, a black-robed gentleman—Identified—in her company. A chitinous sword sits across his back. Around his neck is an emerald mirror, which he wears as an amulet dangling loosely against his bare chest; when mentioned, he gives you a wave and a reserved smile.<br><br>“Who's he?” You ask.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1448522775000,"time4chanFormatted":"11/26/15(Thu)2:26","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1402159896426.jpg","fileSize":"282178 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/43829030/images/1448522775440.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/43829030/thumbs/1448522775440s.jpg","md5":"SPUqqmKAN5IigJZRaJAKYQ==","w":"590","h":"900","tn_w":"81","tn_h":"125"},{"number":"43836610","threadNumber":"43829030","comment":"<a href=\"#p43836593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;43836593</a><br><br>“Oh, a traveler.” He responds. “I was making my way upward, when I found you convulsing on the cavern floor. Thankfully, I had some bandages spare from my last expedition. Once I stopped the bleeding, I elected to do the right thing, and guard you until you came to your senses.”<br><br>“Without him, you'd have been toast.” Cecily shrugs. “I guess not even you can take a fall like that, huh?”<br><br>“I was distracted. But thanks. I owe you.” A brief silence, as you go over your inventory again. Could this guy be with Nephilim? He doesn't look like anyone you've seen; and why would he save you, if he was? “You said you're a traveler? Where from?”<br><br>“To be quite honest, many locales. But most recently, the lands below. Through unfortunate circumstances, I found myself deep beneath the earth, far from my starting zone, and was borne upwards given the barest hints at civilization.” He smiles, pointing to his UI. “I barely managed to make it here, and now... well, my next destination is called Hecatelia. Do you know of it?\"<br><br>“Yeah,” Troja says. “It's the nearest town.”<br><br>“I think we're pretty far along in the progression of things, too.” Vaine says. “Our top guilds are headed for the surface now.”<br><br>“Oh, that's good! It's near? Then I'm much closer than I imagined.” He stands, stretching a bit. “Tell me, then.
