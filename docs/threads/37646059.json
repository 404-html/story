Though they have weak defenses, they can attack from far away, acquiring skills to quickly disengage from combat, acrobatically navigate environments, and move unseen.<br>* Artificer: Artificers are named for their ability to infuse weapons and armor with energy. They are a supportive archetype that can harness elemental abilities, as well as make powerful equipment to be used by themselves or others.<br>* Technician: The Technician is a supportive archetype that can create a variety of machines to serve in and out of combat. Dedicated Technicians can maximize the effectiveness of their abilities by choosing from one of a number of specializations.<br>* Explorer: The Explorer is a supportive archetype with the tools for survival.
