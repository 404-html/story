Meaning we get no benefit from your dumbass idea. 1 strong item with good spread like that paint brush of Pandora's, True sight Eye+ reaction boost+ rapid calculation of Sybil's, Teleport of Anaximander's are greater by far than a suit of disparate low tier items. If the items were intended to be a suit they'd be marked as such, forcing them into one is a waste. <br><br>If you are wanting heavy armor +super fast charge<br><br>You could get the same effect vi buying heavy armor and using a time manip haste, or a flight artifact.

This would allow us to retain our ability to upgrade with credits when we find better gear, and not sperg out spending 15-20 cgs across 5 items and let us spend it all on 1 to make it strong and have good utility.","time":1451024046000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/25/15(Fri)1:14","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
