Because the stakes are (I assume) actually high, maybe not IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE FOR REAL but tangible, observing what happens outside the game is about as important as observations made IG. Admittedly, no matter what, a greater portion of the Quest will happen IG because fights and exploration just takes so much time to write, but inbetween raids we should be forum trawling, maybe start a flame war or two, spot the occasional shitpost from Anaximander, maybe call our parents and tell them we made it through high school without getting hooked on drugs only be taken down by VRMMOs like a punk.","time":1473580044000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/11/16(Sun)3:47","id":"P96o7nY7","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
