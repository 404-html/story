Naming the nameless and giving them equel standing again should go some way to solving the unrest problems. Really we will also need a bag item that can contain the mcguffins everyone wants despite nameless being, normally, unable to carry them. Solve those two issues, and everyones on equel footing and we can start something on our terms to act as a unifying force, like a free company guild.","time":1473539793000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)16:36","id":"T7+2BgkX","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
