I'm on my way back to my hall if you still need me. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Maybe in a minute. I've got an errand to run, and I'm probably going to go farm afterward.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: But we're planning to go to the Sanctum when Nel comes back online.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Want to come along, and see if Kjorikos has any more fancy tech hidden away?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Oh, fuck yes. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( How many are in your group now? ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: It's me, Aelriss, and Tats right now.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Pfft.

It looks like the guardsmen are still on a bit of an alert, with a few more stationed here than the last time you came through.
