The other founders presently plan on investing CGs to set up [2] Advent Gates (1 in Averron City, 1 in the Observatory) but they are willing to defer the allocation of gems for the Observatory to us if we disagree with that step.<br><br>Personally, while the ease of travel from a gate is highly valuable, I think that a Sidereal Armor+NPC Upgrade to it, and self-repairing keepers might be an on-par investment."}
