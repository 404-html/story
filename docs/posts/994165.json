You feel the heat on your face once more as energy gathers and a second heat beam surges across the mesa, the air adjacent visibly quivering. It streaks scorch-marks up the legionnaire’s armor, lurching up from the point of impact and cutting into her side.<br><br>You’ve given Freya time to recover, at least; the legionnaire turns and starts toward you, while the scythe-wielding woman stumbles and collapses dazed – to your surprise, even given a hit like that.<br><br>She’s fast. You have to work quick.<br><br>You wheel around, pre-firing, to cut and dislodge one of the standing stones from its base; tall, but not so thick that you can’t carve through it in time or pick it up. You’re on your feet and running; you lift it from the top, and it comes loose with the sound of earth moving and stone cracking. You whirl around, momentum building into a swing as the enormous legionnaire comes into proximity.<br><br>A clash, as your tools collide, strength matched. The head of her massive axe cuts into the base of the enormous cone you’re hanging onto – sending a long crack down the side of it – but the weapon rebounds.

When she stands before you, you feel hemmed in, as if flanked by a solitary presence. She whirls her axe overhead, swatting Smith’s drone from the air and sending it crashing down near the cave entrance in a heap of scrap. The archer, kneeled a distance away, is pelting her with a volley of arrows that pierces her armored abdomen; she’s unfazed, though, and her motion is carrying through into a wide sweep leveled downward at you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Bash in with your club.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Incinerate her weapon before it makes contact.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Get clear of the axe.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Write-in.</span>","filename":"Smith.jpg","fileSize":"596 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/993431/images/1483170282491.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/993431/thumbs/1483170282491s.jpg","md5":"Yxkuf5Xk+4zvA7eEw9/ecg==","w":717,"h":787,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125}
