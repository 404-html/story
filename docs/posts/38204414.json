I'm glad you're unhurt.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Needless to say, I was not expecting friends. Don't worry about the drone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Viscerators are cheap, if that eases your mind any. The sensor is actually the most expensive part.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: ...They're called viscerators?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Endearing, isn't it?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Something like that.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: I, uhm, saw your trophy case, though.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Did you, now?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: From killing Nameless, right?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Ah, yes.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Most certainly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Yes, I've amassed quite a collection. The technology they operate with exceeds anything we players have access to so far, barring the message board server.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: But I've yet to find any useful application for them. Nothing I've yet tried has allowed me to disassemble one, much less restore a broken one to function.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: I have theories. Interesting theories, but that's a discussion topic for another time.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: All that said, I was just about to return to my workshop, albeit briefly.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Do you think you could meet me by one of the gates, or perhaps the warehouse district?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">> “We're about to head out. The gate sounds fine.”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Suggest meeting elsewhere. (Write-in)</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Ask about something else.
