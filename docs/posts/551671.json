(Write-in.)</span><br>Much like what was announced, the excpetion being those of us with artifacts are going to have to do a lot of the heavy lifting. We're more or less the best Averron has to offer, no matter how impolitic some of us are to each other. That means we're going to have to get along at LEAST until the Troglodytes are sealed. If the leaders and champions cannot get along, how will anyone else who looks to us for guidance? That said we're going to need to have a vague idea of what an artifact does, so we can coordinate better. While exact specifics would likely be great, I do not doubt all of us would rather play it close to the vest. I'd start but I just made mine and haven't used it, so I have very little idea what it does beyond remembering my foes.","time":1473544174000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)17:49","id":"8QIg9CEZ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
