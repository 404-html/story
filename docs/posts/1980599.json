Tell her about our weird experiences with Observers including the login glitch where we fought it's guardian. And show her last argument and tell her about our suspicions concerning the nobility skill it offers and how Hecatel might be exploiting something similar to see if she knows anything about it. <br><br>Also I feel like if anybody would be understanding about our recent visit from Kjorikos it would be her. We should explain our artifact to her as well."}
