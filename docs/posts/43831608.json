They're changing direction now.” Another man responds. “What do you want to do?”<br><br>“The guys below just got a Chthonic slaved with that Artifact.” The first man says. “They're having it circle the cavern right below us and take out anything that comes near. I'm thinking if Faye can get an updated map from the team leader, we can send it up from below once they pass over a hollow enough branch. It won't bring 'em down, but it should do enough damage to let them know that we mean business.”<br><br>“Did she get any info on the members of that scouting party?”<br><br>“Yeah, just some descriptions.
