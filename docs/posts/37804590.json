You hear running water from outside, and the sound of distant hoof-beats on stone, but not much else.

He created a pretty suitable map of the area, but it's not terribly complicated. There's six pillars, three on either side of the room past the disheveled pews; it seems they once held up the ceiling, but are now mostly broken, though they still stand much taller than you.
