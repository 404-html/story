This isn't because an Artifact in the theme of \"lingustics\" wouldn't necessarily work or be effective, but because even though I'm fond of humor (and try to make BSO as funny as possible whenever possible), I don't think I'd allow such a major focal point to be something so inherently silly given that this isn't a \"comedy\" Quest. I suppose I'd -have- to given can-not-continue levels of \"fucking dropped\" shitstorm but I don't think anyone is that attached to an idea that was probably mostly a joke to begin with.<br><br><a href=\"#p44515451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44515451</a><br>Artifact costs are tangled up in the Celestials dispensing information that might be pertinent, and the nature of the Artifact is also determined by what exactly you ask for once you're in front of the Altar. And, I like writing them out. So, not really.","time":1451715502000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/2/16(Sat)1:18","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"}
