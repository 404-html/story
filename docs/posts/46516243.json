A lot of the ideas are good, don't get me wrong, but these are my favorite for Ascheritte in particular. The belt of strength/personal shield is decent (not super exciting to write or use, but certainly a useful Artifact with some potential), as is the \"swim through earth\" Artifact.<br><br>I'd like to leave it up to you guys, if possible (you might end up choosing something that hasn't been yet postulated, or isn't necessarily my favorite), as I don't want to feel like I've railroaded anyone into a choice, but if it really becomes too polarizing I'll do something about it. As is, Ascheritte is already in the price range for a starter Artifact, so we'll see how things pan out, and might even address it next thread."}
