My mailbox has been blowing up.” Vyx says. “By the way, if you were wondering – the big secret is that you pretty much always go full Madcap. My DPS is actually higher when I’m not touching the ground now.”<br><br>The four of you are stationed outside for another minute or so while you wait for Vyx’s invite to arrive. A light-fitting robe worn over armor plates of gray-blue metal, lines of light running all along them: he’s the first person you’ve seen that fits the description that comes to mind when you think of the word Artificer.<br><br>“Alright, everyone – Corny’s here. Let’s get this show on the road!” Vyx says, hopping up like she could sprint right off. “Ashe is tired of waiting.”<br><br>“Vyx.” The Artificer says. “Vyx’s friends. Cornelius. I’m sorry you know her.”<br><br>“Same.” You respond. “Lots of fire in this area, apparently. I should ask now if you’re good with that?”<br><br>“I’m good.” Cornelius says. “Adaptable. Should be able to cover the rough spots and increase our overall damage output. Can’t say the same for Vyx.”<br><br>“Implying I get hit.” Vyx gives a dismissive wave.","time":1508389609000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/19/17(Thu)1:06","id":"FZtRkOsu","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!!lUcx6J6dWDQ","filename":"91824718924.jpg","fileSize":"280070 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/images/1508389609876.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/1978591/thumbs/1508389609876s.jpg","md5":"rBiqB2VHYb3sTJPkHFFXFw==","w":"787","h":"900","tn_w":"109","tn_h":"125"}
