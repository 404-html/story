Same shit-eating grin. You figured he'd have left by now.<br><br>“What do you want?” Sybil asks, hand on the handle of her rapier.<br><br>“Wow, take it easy.” Anaximander shrugs. “What, are we killing each other, now? Is that any way to treat someone who saved your life?”<br><br>“You saved it. Doesn’t mean I owe it to you.” She says, trembling.<br><br>“If you must know, I was on my way to pay the members of Nephilim a visit. To see if we can’t all make nice.” He shakes his head, pushing right through her reprisal. “Securing allies can be good for you, Sybil. You should give it a try sometime.”<br><br>“-You’re- really going to try and make her look bad?” You grit your teeth. “I’m told you’re not wanted around here. Word is Hecatel cast you out, which means if you go back, she’ll snuff you out.”<br><br>“And if she doesn’t, I will.” Sybil says. “We’re both stronger than you are.”<br><br>“If you consider yourself a credit to the Queen’s employ, you should be more adamant about fact-checking.” Anaximander raises his hands in a disarming gesture. “It’s not that she dislikes me.

It’s now a matter of whether or not she behaves as I predict she will.”<br><br>“You’re telling us this, why?” You ask.","filename":"Anaximander.jpg","fileSize":"276 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44363193/images/1451015005600.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44363193/images/1451015005600s.jpg","md5":"SPUqqmKAN5IigJZRaJAKYQ==","w":590,"h":900,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125}
