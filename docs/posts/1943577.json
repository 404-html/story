We got some araneid essence in us that gave us a weak connection to that hivemind when Freya healed us. <br>I'm not sure what capabilities she has but maybe she could study/ run some tests on our Kjorikos lightning as well as our creepy inner essence with that exile memory. Or maybe get some readings on the AOE exile memory dark magic finishing move in the Observatory test chamber as well as our other memories. Plus we can tell her about our mini flashbacks we get each time we activate a memory to see if it aligns with any of the existing lore the writ keepers as a whole have discovered. Letting her focus on lore instead of the stressful merger might even be good for her mental state."}
