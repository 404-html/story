If you have friends, stay with them. Protect one another. We’ll be organizing teams of those who believe themselves capable to sweep and clear areas; others at the vanguard will keep the troglodytes from advancing, while the long ranged attackers can serve as additional area denial and ambush control.” A pause, before Liza turns to you.<br><br>You guess all that sounds standard. Probably could have come up with it yourself.<br><br>Y’know. If you had to. No big deal. Shaking your head, you approach the edge.<br><br>“Keep in mind the numbers at work here,” You shout, leaning over the edge. “Don’t let anyone die to kill one more Exile. There’s too many of them to trade one for one. Likewise, if a party falls under attack, those nearby should move to support. If we can, we’ll have the vanguard on rotation so no one’s taking too much damage at once.”<br><br>“Crafters and gatherers,” Florica says. “Either stick to the safest available areas if you’re combat ready, or form a second group and follow the main fighting force. You’ll get a shot at materials that are, as of now, in locales that are too dangerous to access.”<br><br>“We’ll be prepared to move out soon.” Liza shouts. “Before we go, though—I’d like any willing Artifact users in the crowd to come forward.”","filename":"e102a95e5bc2b5cb8d06feace144b413.jpg","fileSize":"93 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/46639976/images/1460526993783.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/46639976/images/1460526993783s.jpg","md5":"NtjBp1egbxZz7EhD5dCooA==","w":736,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78}
