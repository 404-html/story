Then, you produce your menu and begin messaging:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Tatsumaki ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Tats</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Are you at the observatory?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Tats, you there?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Tatsumaki ]]: ?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Tatsumaki ]]: ya</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Everyone is meeting up for a big hunt. Are you in?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Tatsumaki ]]: ok!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Tatsumaki ]]: inv?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Give me a second.</span><br><br>That was easy.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Aelriss ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Yo Ael</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Aelriss ]]: Oh, hey.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Aelriss ]]: What’s going on? I just got back on and I’m suddenly surrounded by people.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Are you at the Observatory?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Aelriss ]]: Outside, I think? </span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Aelriss ]]: Fuck, I can’t even tell!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Just walk towards the building. You can’t miss me.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: I’ll explain in a sec.</span><br><br>Next!<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Sulya ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: You give Cardus the business for killing himself?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( It felt wrong, so no. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( Need something? )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: You know about the upcoming event, right? City-wide charge on the underground?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( Yeah! I’m working on getting a party together now. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Well, so am I. Want to join up?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( Got space for Cardus and Dorian? )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Unsure, actually! I’ll get back to you in a sec.</span><br><br>One more on the list.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Smith ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: If you’re around the Observatory I’m sure you know what’s going on?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: I heard you and the Crimson Guardians speaking, yes.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Well, I’m forming a party of my own to go down there. Staying loose.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Interested in joining?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Somewhat.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: While frontline combat does sound rather glorious, I have no real desire for recognition.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Likewise, there exists potential to earn an equally significant score without dirtying one’s own hands.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: That is?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: To put it crudely, people will likely die on this mission. It’s unavoidable.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Thus, we’ll see the emergence of caches throughout the underground.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: Rare and unique sundries, Celestial Gems and credits notwithstanding.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Awfully cynical of you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: I think it’s realistic.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Well, regardless, I didn’t take you for a vulture.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: I wouldn’t let such a golden opportunity pass! Besides, it’s merely a thought I had.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: I certainly don’t think of myself as a carrion feeder, but you and I have picked the bones of the fallen before.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: To our mutual benefit, no less!</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Smith ]]: All that aside, I’m certainly not adverse to helping. My drone tech will be very useful if you plan to engage multiple enemies.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: One sec.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1473553967000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/10/16(Sat)20:32","id":"aJoTo80m","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Sulya.jpg","fileSize":"63392 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/images/1473553967596.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/thumbs/1473553967596s.jpg","md5":"mMLB76ikRECatmhSvNt8BQ==","w":"480","h":"800","tn_w":"75","tn_h":"125"}
