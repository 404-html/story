Remember me?” A video feed projects from your Identifier. It's the girl with the goggles, from the tavern; she sounds a little less severe, a lot more laid-back. Out of character, perhaps—wait, she's the leader? “We met a little while ago, when Dorian and I were chatting lore?”<br><br>“Yeah, how could I forget? It hasn't been that long.” You nod. “You put me in the hot seat in front of an audience.”<br><br>“I was actually calling about that.” She laughs. “Sorry, I wanted to apologize. I like pulling people into my madness, though I understand it's not always proper in a game like this.”<br><br>“It's no problem, really.” You nod. “Is that all?”<br><br>“Well, that, and I wasn't expecting your retort.” She says. “You really caught me off guard. This game's lore is really out there if you look for it—there's so much going on, and almost no one willing to try and solve the mystery. I've gotta ask, are you a roleplayer, or were you just putting us on?”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other</span>"}
