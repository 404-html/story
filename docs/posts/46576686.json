If we can get that, the having the cards display unique information, e.g. guild affiliation, arbatery titles and ranks, etc, would also be useful. Have them free distribution, and required to enter the observatory restricted areas for the nameless.<br><br>Its not perfect, but its giving a name to the nameless.
