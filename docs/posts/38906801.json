Splitting them evenly.” Kainzo says. “A pile of crystals. Resonant Fractallines.”<br><br>“Haven't seen those yet.” Ayla says. “They must be a tier up, or they've got a special property. Sounds intense, though. Think you could send 'em my way?”<br><br>“Hold on, there.” Donnel interrupts. “Those would fetch a fair bit of coin on the market if even you haven't heard of them. I think we deserve a cut.”<br><br>“Well, I want new guns.” Vyx pouts.<br><br>“What?
