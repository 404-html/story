Looking down to your right, you see a pair of familiar faces: two of the three Nameless girls you fought outside the Sanctum, identical in all aspects except hair color. They either don’t recognize you, or don’t care, as they answer.<br><br>“Someone opened up a PVP arena.” The redhead speaks up. “If you just got here you probably missed the cool stuff.”<br><br>“Yeah, now it’s more of a Celestial Artifact dickwaving arena.” The green-haired Nameless responds. “I guess it’s still worth watching, especially since people are betting on the matches now.”<br><br>“Sounds interesting.” You wonder how high the stakes are.<br><br>“She hasn’t lost since she got in, but a bunch of people are trying to get her to fight the other Crimson Guardian officer.” Someone else nearby says. “Someone said it might actually happen, so get hype.”<br><br>[[ 1 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Tatsumaki.
