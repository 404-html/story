I understand there are pieces to a SUIT OF ARMOR. Which is why I said MERGE. As in merge in to ONE. If you bothered to read you would have known that.<br><br>So you don't plan on upgrading any celestial equipment? You will continue to create something for every single occasion? That is a waste of gems. <br>Yeah in MMO's you will use many pieces of gear, but there are also \"heirloom\" items that can carry you until close to the very end with out having to change gear.<br>And this is not your typical MMO. Not all games have the same strict rules you've set in your head that all MMO's are alike. <br>And you continue to bring up cost. up cost. The better an item is I am sure it will cost more. That is usually how things work, most people understand that. <br><br>If you still don't get it, think of the armor as a MESH suit you slip on. It has everything from gloves to boots incorporated into it's self. It is a single piece. I am sure I am missing something, as it's only a concept but it brings to the table solutions for current problems. And even if this doesn't get created , may help other ideas. Just want our MC to be able to fight with the best of them. Some times specialization will be your biggest weakness.","time":1451023370000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/25/15(Fri)1:02","id":null,"name":"Sargeras","subject":null,"trip":"!0bTK2D77Xg"}
