There’s the upper platforms near Averron, where crawlers and boss varieties thereof occasionally spawn. Packed with people, probably, but with a number of offshoot caves where you imagine you could find herbs or resources if you were interested in such a thing.<br><br>The cave where you, Aelriss, and Tatsumaki encountered the frog boss was cleared out not too long ago, and now serves as a hunting ground for more of the oversized insects. The part you didn’t get to, however, is an only-partly-mapped dungeon area full of the things: a proper hive, as it were. It’s not known how deep it goes, but save for the “sliverwing queen”, presented with a cross-posted bestiary entry, there haven’t been too many new discoveries in the mapped area.<br><br>An underground lake in a branch a distance straight below the outside of the ex-Sanctum appears to be home to rare aquatic creatures: primarily water skirters and lake sprites, as well as some rumored rare spawns that haven’t been documented, leading some to believe they aren’t actually real. Further down, the first open magma branch was discovered a while back, and hasn’t been explored thoroughly save for the adjacent locations populated with aethersteel and elemental beasts.<br><br>The deepest documented area is the Araneid nest, far below. The creatures encountered there have been the source of a number of more exotic weapons and materials, and the associated lore suggests the presence of a very powerful NPC somewhere in the unexplored part of the area—likely a Precursor."}
