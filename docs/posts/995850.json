Above you, Aelriss maneuvers away instinctively, which leaves the rope unsteady; you see Crow barely hang on right above you as it swings to the right, and almost lose grip yourself. The drone’s attention is shifted upward when it’s hit by another pair of caster bolts, which burst into light and smoke on contact; when it turns, an arrow fired from the top of the cliff strikes dead center in its chest, sending it falling down into the dark of the Claw.<br><br>“Steady!” Varrin shouts. “You’re clear!
