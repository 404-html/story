That we would have to know the tree and plan for that.<br><a href=\"#p44368925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44368925</a><br>But it does solve all of our problems right? Seems like it should be possible. Seems like It could be easily an end game item we keep powering up to catch up to other stuff we get later on. And I am sure we could lessen the count by say, building the armor our self. Adding a few of the bonuses we want to it. Costs us some credits to lessen the cost of the creation/transformation into the artifact.<br>Anyone see any real problems with this idea? But I do agree it will likely cost more than 2-3 gems. easily more but as I said before you get what you pay for."}
