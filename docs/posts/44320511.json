Perhaps some kind of empathic effect, or being able to see their tangle of emotions that drives them, or something. Having dealt with Kjorikos I can't help but feel we might well find ourselves in situations where a silver tongue could be more rewarding than a big sword. (This isn't really something I'd go for, but hopefully acts as fuel for thought for more interesting artifacts than BELT OF STRENGTH). I figure we would be able to delve deeper in the lore with something like this though<br>- I forgot what I was going to add, distracted by my brother<br><br>Anyway, I don't think we should rush into making one as soon as we can unless we actually KNOW what we want, and I also think we can dream a bit bigger than the suggestions so far. The cloak of temp invulnerability could be good though, no doubt the fact it's only effective on the bearer would allow us to use it more than Kainzo's shield since his can protect multiple allies.<br><br><a href=\"#p44320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44320433</a><br>I haven't the slightest idea what you're trying to say."}
