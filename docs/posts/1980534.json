Ayla is lying on her back in the middle of the floor like she’s making a snow angel; she wears bracers and anklets of an unknown material with lines of light down their sides, reminiscent of the Unique Identifiers themselves. A drill half her size is spinning on a motorized torque-ring nearby, and there’s the cannibalized parts of half-built explosive devices lying all over the place. Every table and sitting space, and most of the walls, are covered in notes that look like someone’s been trying to solve upper-level calculus problems using ancient script in place of numbers; similar pages are strewn about the floor.<br><br>“What did you need?” She asks, staring at the ceiling as you enter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; “Checking in to see if you’re alright.”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; “Like I said: here to talk lore.”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.
