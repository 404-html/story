Plan that out, and maybe take a break.”<br><br>“That sounds fine with me.” Aelriss says. “Thought about who else you want to come?”<br><br>“Well, there's Nel and Donnel...” You nod.<br><br>“Uh,” She looks at you. “I thought we were already going to invite them.”<br><br>“Right.” You respond.<br><br>“That's a full party, then?” She asks.<br><br>“Well, I was thinking we could maybe bring more than one party. We don't know how tough it's going to be in there, right?” You fold your arms. “Like, a raid.”<br><br>“Huh, interesting.” Aelriss says. “What makes you say that?”<br><br>“I'd like Ayla to be able to get down there to use the tech, but she's busy with her guild. Which is why I wanted to suggest a group expedition. We'd bring a second party of people from the Alliance guilds.” You respond.<br><br>“Sounds like a good idea. You're sure you're not just trying to get on Ayla's good side?” She pauses, then sticks her tongue out.<br><br>“Yeah, whatever.” You roll your eyes, waving her off.
