Can you find those people?<br>-If we've got an item that can distract the snipers, then line up and activate [Celestial Technique: Divine Spear] at them. Then have Florica watch and act as a 1-2 punch (or if they've moved she can take down their new position). If we don't have an item, let Florica pull the distraction and then we'll toss the spear.<br>-Freya, Aelriss, advance while we distract them. If Nel finds anything then try to deal with it until we and Florica can catch up."}
