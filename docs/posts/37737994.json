Get back, now!\" There's a sudden shift in the ground, throwing your balance as you draw within proximity. <br><br>It's already here.<br><br>The earth in front of you cracks, and bends up into a mound before shattering. A blast of light. You're bombarded by sharp bits of rock from in front, and bring your arms up to shield your face. It hits you head on, mouth-parts clamping together around your ankle, and throws you skyward with a barreling, rag-doll swing. <br><br>You see blood. It hurtsâ€”not real pain, but that same dull feeling you got when you were last hit.<br><br>[[ Ascheritte: 13 / 24 HP ]]<br><br>It's below you, and much larger than the other three, about as big as a van, were you in real life.
