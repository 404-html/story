Aelriss and Tatsumaki shrink behind you.<br><br>“Good to see you again, Ascheritte.” Smith smiles, formal as always. You don't see any drones with him, but he can probably store them in his UI, which seems convenient. “You've got my chips?”<br><br>“Mhm.” You produce the luminescent diskettes and hand them over. “Didn't spend a cent of it.”<br><br>“I thank you.” He says. “What are you and your friends up to?”<br><br>“Not much. Maybe about to do some farming, maybe not.” You shrug. “You?”<br><br>“The usual.” Smith says. “And a bit of exploring. Looking for altars, and nice places. Haven't found much of anything exciting yet, though, and the message boards are down, which means maps of the furthest branches aren't being spread. You should carry exploring gear, though. The terrain gets quite nasty once you stray too far away from Averron.”<br><br>“Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.” You say. He nods and waves you off, making a cautious exit towards the far caves, periodically looking over his shoulder.<br><br>What will you do?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Get to farming, starting with these stupid crawlers.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Go find a better farming spot; like where you lost Rhett.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Start exploring a different branch below.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other</span>"}
