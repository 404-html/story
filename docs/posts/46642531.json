There's no fucking way we'll be able to get an excavator rolling with all our supply lines being attacked or trapped by them. Odds are by the time we're ready Hecatalia will have beaten us the punch. If not we can work on it after we get an excavator up and running. If he's as abd as I saw he was we might need several cities worth of players to take the promenade anyways."}
