Bonus points if it can be reworked with the Royal Guard helm and both modified to work with Strife Memoriam while retaining the Nobility trait. (I&#039;m hopeful Nobility might make the Obby Pegasus more receptive to us when we visit it again).<br><br>The gauntlets can be replaced with nearly anything for a practical upgrade.<br><br>Our starplate leggings...I dunno. I like the sound of the Royal Guard Faulds better really.","time":1554264064000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/03/19(Wed)00:01:04","id":"V2h2oypP","name":"Anonymous"}
