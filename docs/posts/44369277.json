A suit of armor that works together. To achive it's best potential. Only issue would be putting on and taking off the armor. but don't see the alter really screwing with us on that cause i think we don't really take our shit off ingame for any real reasons anyway.<br><br>Just saying we should at least ask about it next time. Having a few pieces put together already to merge and upgrade into a whole. Should off set the cost.","time":1451018897000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/24/15(Thu)23:48","id":null,"name":"Sargeras","subject":null,"trip":"!0bTK2D77Xg"}
