You got a free upgrade?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: The implication is that there’s only a limited amount of Celestial stuff in the world.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: Or a limited amount of Celestial… power, in the world, divided evenly across all the existing Celestial stuff.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: Less stuff means the existing stuff has a greater share of the power, in the simplest possible terms.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: Both creating and destroying new areas advances the game.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: So you knew I blew up the Altar because something got better.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: Yes. I have reason to believe our enemies will grow stronger as well, but—facing stronger foes is inevitable.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: The Crimson Guardians and the Disposable Heroes have also prepared their investment into the Observatory. We’re waiting for Ayla to return to discuss the bulk expenditure, but she’s been off for a while.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: In other news, there’s a 50,000# bounty on you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I know.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: What are you going to do?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I was hoping you’d help. It was placed because I have something to do with the araneids of Tethiss’s Claw.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I’m going to go there and figure out what’s wrong and how to fix it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: And you’re asking me to…?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Buy me time? Anything you can do to stop people from hunting me would be great, foremost.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Crimson Guardian Liza ]]: I’ll get the word out.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Contact Request Sent: Sven ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ UI Messenger – Sven ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Hey, Sven. It’s Ashe, from the Alliance meeting.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Sven ]]: Hey, Ashe. Been a minute. What do you know good?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I was wondering if you could help me out.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: There’s a huge bounty on my head because I have something to do with Tethiss’s Claw.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I’m going to go there and try to solve the problem so people stop dying.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: But I can’t do that if everyone in Averron is trying to kill me.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Sven ]]: Oh, geez.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Sven ]]: I don’t think I can help with that, but I’ll at least try to tell the guild to hold off on bounty hunting today.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: That’s perfect. All I need is a little damage control. I owe you one.</span>","time":1554250443000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/02/19(Tue)20:14:03","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"Sven.jpg","fileSize":"182361 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554250443922.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554250443922s.jpg","md5":"r0i3pEBoTWXqYH/KMnYWyg==","w":736,"h":1102,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125}
