I'm sure even if we do our best to avoid the main point of the game, we're in danger of being killed in game or worse by the Observers. And as one of the few players who know about them it's our responsibility to educate and unite the players against them. Plus it might let us help Ayla out, who we can reasonably assume is fucked without our help against the Observers. I have no issue with including Nameless in our guild and making things easier for them, they're a mostly untapped resource and can definitely be equipped better to become more effective. But we stand no chance against the Observers at large without a unified effort to combat them. <br><br>None of the ideas to help out other players are mutually exclusive to an anti-Observer guild. But our current method of just surviving the Observers' attacks in unsustainable."}
