If we invest in Saber, and then wind up using a longsword or something later, it could be inferred as a waste of EXP, especially if we end up creating a straight sword artifact. The same goes for two-handed: if we wind up not specializing into it, it would be a waste of EXP. Now, Weapon Master applies to any weapon we wield, so the 'specialization' 'specialization' argument cannot be used there.<br><br>Again, there is no reason to not pick it up.","time":1423296023000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/7/15(Sat)3:00","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
