We'll want to be on the far side so we can go at it from the arm that's more damaged already.”<br><br>“I think so.” Aelriss responds. “Unless she got turned around, which is entirely possible. If anything, we'll want to be at a diagonal, to minimize the distance you have to cross if we're on the wrong side.”<br><br>“Hey, Ashe!” On the far side of the central chamber, you see Nel leading a small group—Donnel, Dorian, and Andor—face dimly illuminated from below by his map projection. “Glad to see you're on your feet!”<br><br>“Yes, you've made a lot of people very upset.” Dorian sighs.<br><br>“That's cool,” You say. “I'll make up for it. Where do you want us, Nel?”<br><br>“Aelriss gave me the low-down on everything that's going on here, so just pick a spot I guess. Once I work out positions for the four of us I'm going to defer to your judgment.” He says, folding his arms. “Sticking with Aelriss?”<br><br>“Yeah,” You nod. “You know, I don't trust her alone.”<br><br>“Hey.” Aelriss snaps. “Watch it.”<br><br>“Take it easy, you two. Nel, Kainzo was right, wasn't he?” Andor says. “See? There's more ways to contribute to a team than just dealing damage. Without a map of this place, we'd have been picked off one-by-one.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Continued ]]</span>","time":1427169175000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/23/15(Mon)23:52","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Dorian.jpg","fileSize":"83828 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38900585/images/1427169175017.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38900585/thumbs/1427169175017s.jpg","md5":"kueEHyd/Pmju+ZSsDSd71w==","w":"534","h":"1024","tn_w":"65","tn_h":"125"}
