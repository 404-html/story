It would allow Aelriss to get Euonia back, it's almost certainly a blindside, and the initiative would be ours instead of theirs.<br><br>But the realization does make me less opposed to charging them head-on. They didn't think they could take on our party full-strength and win, they thought they could take on our party after we were weakened by battling through the most deadly place known around Averron. That's a significant difference."}
