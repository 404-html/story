Normally, you'd dive-roll, but you don't want to roll around in this, even in a video game. A jet of visibly-burning liquid passes through the space you occupied a moment ago, and puddles at Aelriss's feet; she freezes for a second before stumbling backward, bumping into the cave wall.<br><br>“Aelriss, move!” You shout, whirling back around. You move back into range, dodging on the spot as forelimbs pass overhead. The sliverwing doubles back and crashes down, and you raise your blade to parry, stopping them a foot away from your face and forcing the thing back, spilling burning blood to the cave floor.<br><br>There's a sound, familiar though alien, a loud metallic screaming as a beam of searing golden light blasts into the sliverwing's side and sweeps across, dividing it in half horizontally and cauterizing the wound.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Aelriss defeated sliverwing.

This cavern, though, is quite spacious already. You hope there's no more sliverwings.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other</span>"}
