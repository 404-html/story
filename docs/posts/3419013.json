Anything we've done to help another dude out has been voluntary. We don't owe anyone anything, and more importantly there isn't anyone joining us because THEY feel a responsibility to tell everyone about observers.<br><br>I think the other anons above already pointed it out, but just as a lot of policies aren't mutually exclusive to being an anti-observer guild, very few anti-observer things are mutually exclusive to having a much different core focus for the guild.<br><br>There's very few actual resources we can pour into investigating anti-observer methods; we're not even sure if we can put gems towards that goal. We'll just be asking people to look at Throne, and for that it's better to NOT be in a guild since then it's easier to collaborate with people across different guilds.<br><br>We've got mass production of curse-resistant gear, but since we don't know HOW to make that we're left with making lots of gear period and just swapping out whenever you get cursed.....which is what I'm pushing for with maxing out Aethersteel production.<br><br>Given how we're still fumbling in the dark, outright declaring war on observers sounds like a poor first step. If we're forced to do so to save Ayla, sure, but making a guild and telling EVERYONE could just drag them into the observer mess before they're ready."}
