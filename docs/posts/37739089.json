[[ Party: Vision, Tatsumaki, Ascheritt, Rhett ]]</span><br><br>\"Come on!\" Nel shouts. He pulls both of his blades from between the dead crawler's eyes, and lunges to the side of the giant one, repeatedly striking its exoskeleton. He's trying to get its attention, pull it away from the group. <br><br>He moves it into position for you, and you swing at it as you come down, hooking your blade into its back and swinging into its hard body: better than hitting the ground. You feel something give, and worry that your sword might have been damaged, but don't have time to think about it.<br><br>It screeches, and you pull your blade free, you and Nel running in the same direction on opposite sides of the thing. Your ankle looks torn, and you're not sure how you can still run as well as you are. Rhett is still struggling with the last of the crawlers that emerged earlier; you see him miss a swing, and then, things take a quick turn for the worse as it tackles him to the ground and begins thrashing on top of him.<br><br>It's slithering toward you and Nel, body undulating, sending reverberations through the ground with each minute movement of its massive, segmented body. On one side, Tatsumaki and Vision look for a way inside. On the other, the last of four Crawlers appears to be crushing Rhett to death.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Other</span><br><br><a href=\"#p37738339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37738339</a><br><br>You kind of have to fiddle with it a bit. You could definitely take something out in combat, but not necessarily while under attack, and probably not while falling toward uncertain doom.","time":1422681459000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/31/15(Sat)0:17","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"}
