You can't just stick them on to heavier armor and expect the same bonuses, that's why I said it would be a more involved process. To get a true upgrade, you would need to remove and replace different bits, which is a level of granularity I'm not sure is practical in this quest, and it might be better to just have separate silverwing and aethersteel pieces anyway.","time":1508895021000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/24/17(Tue)21:30","id":"kM/5uzUA","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
