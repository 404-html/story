Required for: \"Overpower\", \"Charge\", \"Whirlwind Attack\".<br>We should learn Charge too soon after, to compliment<br>* Power Charge [[ Granted by: pegasus gilded cuirass ]]: Charging attacks will resist interruption and behave as if you are heavier.<br>We don't have a skill that spends PP so it's just sitting there. And should be a nice addition to our damage letting us kill shit faster. And moving around enemies to position ourselves better, by knocking them away from allies or just away from us.","time":1425346157000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/2/15(Mon)20:29","id":null,"name":"Sargeras","subject":null,"trip":null}
