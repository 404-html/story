We might fight a guy with time fuckery powers anyway and nab those powers with our Strife.<br><br>I say we keep pumping it into the strife and make it better. If we could keep the memories up for however long we want, that would go a long way. I'd even argue it's better than throwing more skills on us as we could instead potentially have a wider range of skills to use without the need to manage SP due to the memories. Just throw all of our SP into the thing."}
