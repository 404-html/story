Earn us brownie points with the guilds and help keep the city a viable place for non-nameless to use. The less we help out, the more UI bearing players die, the more nameless there are for next time.<br><br><a href=\"#p37894445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37894445</a><br>Yeah, but you're using speculation as reasons we should avoid the CG. It's like saying \"well in France they MIGHT all be rabid, so we shouldn't go there for holiday\" rather than \"well they might NOT be rabid, let's look at a brochure\""}
