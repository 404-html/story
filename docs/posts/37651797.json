You'd say that was pretty damn good, for your first fight, but the realism is still a bit unsettling; you think you'd like to avoid further combat until you know what's going on, seeing as you just loaded into this game. The two nameless are down for the count; the Explorer is coughing up blood, and it looks like his ribcage is a bit depressed from where you landed on it, meanwhile the girl is lying motionless a ways away. “Guess I didn't know my own strength. You know why these guys tried to kill me?”<br><br>“That's how most of the nameless act, I'm afraid. Luckily we've got the advantage in combat over them. Some of them can live long enough to gain a few levels, maybe farm an Artificed weapon. But they can't use Celestial equipment or artifacts. Without a UI, you can't even pick up the Gems to make 'em. The game's harder for them for plenty of other reasons, too.” You take a good look at him, as he speaks; his voice is stern, features rugged.

You said the game is harder for them?” You ask. “Why's that?”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ 1/2 ]]</span>"}
