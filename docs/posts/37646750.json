The Artificer and Tech look pretty cool. You see the former wielding an elementally-charged staff, preparing to cast some sort of spell, while the latter is shown in multiple environments; he's commanding a couple of spherical droids in one, and darting about in a crude exoskeleton in another.<br><br>If you're choosing your 'primary archetype', it stands to reason you'll be able to get another one sometime. You think it'll be one of those two; you bet you could make a damn cool technoknight.<br><br>What else?
