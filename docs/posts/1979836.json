I'm chalking it up to stress and lack of sleep because she's afraid of missing something.<br> The crimson guardians are the elite guild. You're taking the best players from the other guilds with the best gear and best resources. Yes you're doing it for all the right reasons but you're leaving people out in the cold. Combined with a lot of people getting set back to square one and your reputation lots of people who don't know you are going to see it as a power move. This game breeds inequality and having one ruler with her guild above everyone else, intentional or not is going to breed hate. It's mitigated now because you're not the only game in town. Whether intentional or not, you're setting yourself up to be another Hecatel.","time":1508286803000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/17/17(Tue)20:33","id":"q0QKSGnz","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
