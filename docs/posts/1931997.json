The enormous weapon is heavy, but you can make it work; chances are good your foes maneuver unwittingly into your improved strike range, and the significant increase in striking power is certainly welcome given the kinds of foes you’ve been pitted against lately. You can hardly imagine even the King’s Hand getting up and walking away after a swing of this. Probably best not to think about what it’d do given a solid hit on another player. You go ahead and purchase a whetstone for another 300# - it seems like exactly the kind of thing that’ll come in handy as a just-in-case - leaving you with 4045#.<br><br>“Can I melt these earthsea coins down for raw materials?” You ask.<br><br>“That would be highly disrespectful. All currency is worth something to <span class=\"mu-i\">someone</span>.” The Forgemaster responds. “Likewise, the metal these coins are minted from is scarcely useful for capable weaponry.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sell your iron scimitar for 475#.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Repair your bastard sword, the old broken sword, or both.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Depart.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.
