It'll have to spread purely by word of mouth since posts about it always get deleted from the forums. <br><br>This whole time we've just been doing our best to react to what the Observers do to fuck with us. It's time to be proactive. <br><br>This idea might be crazy, but what if we created hallowed ground as a way to lure in Observers to learn more about them and destroy them? Prepare a trap. If our Memory of the Throne power is divine and truly effective against them we should have the best artificers study it and try to replicate it for others."}
