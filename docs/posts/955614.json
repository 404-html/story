You say nothing, but raise your eyebrows briefly, glossing over her statement.<br><br>“I’m not going to pretend I can read your mind, either.” She smirks. “The fact of the matter is the game they’re playing isn’t good for anyone. I think it would be a shame if you had no place to call your own when the dust settles, once they discover that themselves.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ UI Messenger – Aelriss ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Aelriss ]]: I don’t know if it's right for us to blame anyone for this mess, though.
