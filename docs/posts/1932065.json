We need a forward base for the Earthsea. I really wanna try out our new exile memory too. Also we should probably just save our gems until we get a few more. I'm not sure how artifact upgrades work but 2 gems seems a little low for any significant effects. What kind of upgrades would you guys want? I posted a few in the titanpad a while ago but that website might be dead at this point. I'll see if I can find em.","time":1507171598000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/4/17(Wed)22:46","id":"TS8DhpfM","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
