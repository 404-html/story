A suit like I stated before. <br>With there being nothing wrong to adding an ability to it later on like you want to do with some thing.<br>Having a single piece that we could work on being heavily powered in one direction or many.<br>Instead of multiple pieces that will be bleh eventually. <br>And that is the point of a celestial artifact. You do not throw celestial artifacts away. You power them up, when you have the ability to do so. <br>How would it be wasteful, if you will continue to power said item up? Or do you plan to invest gems into one shot items and throw them away?<br>I do like Spirit channeling, seems like it could help. Channeling earth to make x tougher. Wind for speed, fire damage, water healing/flexibility.","time":1451022038000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/25/15(Fri)0:40","id":null,"name":"Sargeras","subject":null,"trip":"!0bTK2D77Xg"}
