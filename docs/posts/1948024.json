Not how I would personally use gems, but I wouldn't vote against pursuing it if it had a lot of support. When all is said and done we can do both of these things in town, but I admit it's convenient.<br><br><a href=\"#p1947985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1947985</a><br>That would be pretty cool.","time":1507560534000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/9/17(Mon)10:48","id":"Ib0XQwQQ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
