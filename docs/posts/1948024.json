Dross is our bootknife, or equivalent at least, and a handgun would be a good ranged option that only requires one hand compared to the rifle we have.</span><br><br>Good point.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perk</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The perk doesn't let us hand-off an oversized weapon, only two-have weapons as a note. So we could use a shield or gun with a two-handed weapon but a collosal one would still require two hands.</span><br><br>I believe you're right. Thanks for catching that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Celestial Gems</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We need mor--I mean I agree with all points given.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, I would suggest also looking at auto-repair/identify stuff too simply because it would save us time and effort along with thread life. Not something to do ASAP but something to keep in mind, we would hopefully not need more than one gem to get them each, or possibly both.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We could also monetize it by being a travelling repair/identify one shop stop, to boot.</span><br><br>Interesting idea. Not how I would personally use gems, but I wouldn't vote against pursuing it if it had a lot of support. When all is said and done we can do both of these things in town, but I admit it's convenient.<br><br><a href=\"#p1947985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1947985</a><br>That would be pretty cool."}
