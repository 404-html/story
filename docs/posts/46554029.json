It’ll only bolster Freakshow’s ranks, with Nameless who are sick of being hated on and Identified who agree they’re being persecuted.” You nod. “And then there’s the types Freya mentioned, who don’t even care who they kill.”<br><br>“Exactly.” Andor says.<br><br>“What this looks like from the outside is the Crimson Guardians making a power play to seize control of the city. It’ll lead to a civil war that’ll make our previous debacle look tame.” You suggest. “I think you should rethink your approach.”<br><br>“What are you suggesting?” Liza asks.<br><br>“There are dangerous and highly skilled Nameless out there—believe me, I got jumped by three of them with killer intent the moment I spawned. Things aren’t going to get better unless we work at it. We either let Nameless into the ranks of the Alliance under the same circumstances we let Identified in, or work on a way to solve their problems, be it Identified offering aid or contributing Gems to a way to restore their UIs.” You nod.<br><br>“I’m actually alright with that last idea.” Mendicant says. “As a first order of business for us, I mean—there’s got to be some way to do it. I’ve seen a lot of good people bite it, and if any group of people can amass enough Gems to make it possible, it’s the ones in this room.”","time":1460170271000,"time4chanFormatted":"4/8/16(Fri)22:51","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Mendicant.jpg","fileSize":"585973 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/46550137/images/1460170271467.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/46550137/thumbs/1460170271467s.jpg","md5":"+78OE3ab9LfAS7jV7nbizg==","w":"850","h":"1163","tn_w":"91","tn_h":"125"}
