We should probably be aware of the status quo before we try and head back as a group of injured players.\"<br><br>\"I've got someone.\" Donnel says. \"Give me a second.<br><br>\"So do I,\" You respond, pulling up Smith in your contacts list. \"Let me make a call.\"<br><br>Your UI brings up a video of him at a metal desk, room illuminated by a single lamp. His goggles are pulled up, and he looks to have been working with small tools, and some type of arc welder. You can see the workshop door, a ways behind him, and hear distant shouting.<br><br>\"Ascheritte!\" He smiles. \"I pray you have been doing well since we last met. Do you need something?\"<br><br>\"I just heard there was some kind of uprising going on in Averron.\" You respond. \"I'm out, so I wanted to see how safe it is. How are you? Is everything alright?\"<br><br>\"I'm doing well.\" Smith chuckles. \"I've recently come into some money, so I decided to spend a bit on my drones. The attack in Averron has become a bit worrisome, but I feel the Alliance will soon have things under control. Nameless are that way for a reason, after all, but their numbers are quite great, even here. They've killed quite a few, swarming streets and entire buildings. Only the halls, and some of the houses, are truly safe. Even my workshop is in a bit of a problem area...\"<br><br>\"Smith! You goddamn PKer!\" The door behind him slams open, and a pair of players stomp in. They're wearing identical guild tabards, but you can't see the symbol at this distance and resolution. \"Did you really think you could get away with that?\"<br><br>Smith smiles, and a spherical drone rises into the air from the ground on either side of him. Retractable blades emerge from one, while the other crackles with electrical arcs. He leans close to the camera, and pulls down his goggles.<br><br>\"Ascheritte, I'm afraid something's come up. I'll call you back.\"<br><br>What will you do?<br><span class=\"quote\">> Other</span>","time":1423290858000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/7/15(Sat)1:34","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"}
