Keep people on rotation to press them back. Snipers for area denial. Once we get some supply routes opened back up we have some brawlers escorting explorers and resource gatherers for mat gathering. This is going to be a war. We need supply lines gathering and crafters crafting ASAP.","time":1460524731000,"time4chanFormatted":"4/13/16(Wed)1:18","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
