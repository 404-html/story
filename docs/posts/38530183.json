The way our guild operates, we like to know with certainty that you're an active player, someone who's interested in betterment, influence, and what's good for Averron. We don't judge a lot based on current equipment, but do care about accomplishments, and try to hash together some sort of test of skill. You'll have to talk to Mendicant, if you're truly interested; he's around here, just ask someone on your way out and we can handle it now.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> You're about done here.
