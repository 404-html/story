It’s difficult for us to determine whether what we’ve got going currently works on a model that’s any way derived from real-life physics.” She responds. “If it does, we’ll probably stumble across a way to find out how far apart we are from one another and how large the game world actually is. More likely, we’ll have to resort to more magic or advanced technology.”<br><br>“I heard her say something about Scrying?” You ask.<br><br>“Mhm. It’s a topic of interest.” Ayla says. “I might take it up with the fortune teller—that seems like a good idea. Increasing our range, we can start working on now. First, though, I want to organize an effort, just so I don’t have to pull everything out of my own guild bank to do it.”<br><br><a href=\"#p44508350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44508350</a><br><br>“How about the Excavator? How far off are we from that?” You ask.<br><br>“That’s also an issue of materials, but design plays a role.
