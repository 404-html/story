The exact configuration was varied but it was typically either a hammer on the front and a spike on the back or an axe on the front and a hammer on the back. The weapon usually had a spike on the top and bottom too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">>supposed to be gamechangers</span><br>Gamechangers yes, but quest-changers... Not so much. The timepiece would augment our current approach to fights and the game itself outside of fights. The totem would potentially upend our fighting style depending on what it could actually do and as far as I understand we'd end up spending a lot of time outside combat devoted to chasing down new and more powerful spirits. I can't help but suspect that would in turn involve a lot of backplot and so on due to the nature of this game and I fear it would detract from the /important/ backplot - that which relates to precursors and everyone's bid for the surface.<br><br>It just feels to me like there would be overall too much distraction from what this quest currently is.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">>timepiece is MORE exotic than the paintbrush</span><br>Sorry, poor choice of word I guess. I didn't mean that the paintbrush is more powerful/beyond one's grasp/divine/??? (can't find the words to explain what I mean) than being able to control time. What I meant was that it was more unusual, a more imaginative power, more of a personal one.","time":1457867870000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/13/16(Sun)7:17","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
