You carry a coat of ash beneath you that twists and dissipates slowly as you maneuver out of the suffocating cloud. Ducking under fallen archways and rising over bridges, you search for the heart of this place. “The denizens of the Earthsea were punished as traitors by the mad King, and forced into exile, to sleep within the earth or forever walk among its deepest paths.”<br><br>Faintly glowing red eyes blink open in the distant darkness.
