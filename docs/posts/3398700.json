This would likely let us remove the curses from our equipment (might be easier to just farm more materials for them. Particularly, silverwing materials correspond well with our playstyle and the Forgemaster could likely make us a matching set of gear if we brought enough), it would also prompt Observer attacks or Observer-backed attacks.","time":1554152399000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/01/19(Mon)16:59:59","id":"V2h2oypP","name":"Anonymous"}
