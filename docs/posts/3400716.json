Meanwhile, Freya kills whoever she deems fit. That’s why there’s a price on her head too. Don’t confuse us, for your sake.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: You have to be in Averron to add to the trust, right?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: You can go remotely through the forums, but it’s linked to your Unique Identifier. Can’t hide your identity—it’s part of why the system works.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: We don’t know of anyone outside the city that’s achieved access to our servers, so...</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: The Calamity Sage is someone in the city?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Signs point to yes, unless something beyond our understanding is happening.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Well, look. You’re not really in a great place here either, you realize? </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: The whole deal with the Rift wasn’t just to save us, which it was. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: It was to convince people that this game isn’t ruled by the rich. If people find out this part of the story…</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: I know. I know. That’s why I’m trying to help you.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: If I can solve this problem with Tethiss’s Claw, will you sort out the bounty?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Yeah. I’ll do everything I can in that case. But if you don’t, it’s just gonna get worse, one way or another.</span><br><br>[[ 1 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Allocate the Memory of Rust.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Allocate the Memory of Fire.</span><br><br>[[ 2 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on Armsmaster perks.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on Guardian perks.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on Fleetfoot perks.</span><br><br>[[ 3 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Canderence.
