Whether that's true: the answer lies below. Whoever lived down there worshipped the Celestials as well, though perhaps in different ways. With a close eye, you might find the artifacts of gods, the Celestial Gems. You could even encounter a Materialization Altar.\"<br>\"Their technology was more advanced than you may think; you might find blueprints in unlikely places. Within the old cathedral lurks a powerful entity called Kjorikos. To reach this place, you must first find and defeat the Obsidian Pegasus.\"","time":1422762902000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/31/15(Sat)22:55","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
