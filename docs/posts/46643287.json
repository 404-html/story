Normally generic enemies wouldn't be an issue worth an announcement, but these guys are different. They kill players, hunt for them and lay traps around anything of value. They've spread far and wide, hell I don't think you could leave the Observatory or Averron without seeing some, or being seen by some. Not only are they aggressive to us, they are aggressive to everything else too. They're destroying camping gorunds, trapping farming spots, and spreading even farther. If they keep coming they'll press into the safe zones. I short they are a massive threat to everyone. These guy are coming from a damaged seal deep in the Earth. So we need to come together, clear the grounds and find it so we can fix it and put them back in their box. Now I know what you're thinking, \"what's in it for me?\" Well besides the return of local farming and camping grounds, you get secuirirty, no more enemies bushwhacking you from surprise, you get loot, these guys are unique, and instanced event the can have decent items. You'll get experience, they are lots of these guys, and they're worth a decent chunk of exp, and then you'll get prestige. All of you who want that fortune teller and other npcs to think you important? Now's your chance. All of Averron needs to come together and push the exiles, back. It doesn't matter whether your nameless or identified, we need you!","time":1460522856000,"time4chanFormatted":"4/13/16(Wed)0:47","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
