Plus, most of them aren't bad players, either. Not the best, but they're not bad, and they can be relatively inclusive when given the opportunity. If we're going for one of the big three guilds, I'd vote for the Writ Keepers.","time":1422510242000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/29/15(Thu)0:44","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
