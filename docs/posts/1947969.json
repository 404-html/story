Rubi won't let us do more damage, but it would probably prevent all fatigue build up and allow us to use an oversized weapon as deftly as a fencing sword.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dross vs Gun</span><br>I don't see a reason we can't use both, honestly. Dross is our bootknife, or equivalent at least, and a handgun would be a good ranged option that only requires one hand compared to the rifle we have.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perk</span><br>The perk doesn't let us hand-off an oversized weapon, only two-have weapons as a note. So we could use a shield or gun with a two-handed weapon but a collosal one would still require two hands.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Celestial Gems</span><br>We need mor--I mean I agree with all points given.<br><br>However, I would suggest also looking at auto-repair/identify stuff too simply because it would save us time and effort along with thread life. Not something to do ASAP but something to keep in mind, we would hopefully not need more than one gem to get them each, or possibly both.<br><br>We could also monetize it by being a travelling repair/identify one shop stop, to boot."}
