The massive capital cost needed to collect weapons and maintain them make it impractical. Even just buyin a crapload of cheapos would be expensive, especially if you want elemental diversity. Better off sticking them in your armor or making aethersteel.<br><br>It is a terrible idea, especially for BSOQ.<br><br><a href=\"#p46507029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;46507029</a><br>Its either broken or useless, and i dont like such an extreme dichotomy."}
