Who gave her 48k.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Continuing. A few people corroborated her report and threw in a few hundred each because they were curious too. Saying they’d heard your name, or they knew who you were from the Observatory.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: When it got to 10k, my lieutenant, Bladez, doubled it out of pocket because he wanted to see what would happen.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: That was a couple hours ago.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: There’s 30,000# missing here.

I’m trying to figure that out right now.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: One anonymous guy left 30k. He have any alias?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: They’re called the ‘Calamity Sage’.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: So this is a callout that went viral, and now everyone in Averron wants to cash in on my head like I’m a walking lottery.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Yes.</span><br><br>[[ 1 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Keep the Memory of Exile allocated to Strife Memoriam.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Allocate the Memory of Rust.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Allocate the Memory of Marble.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Allocate the Memory of Fire.</span><br><br>[[ 2 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on Armsmaster, Guardian, or Fleetfoot perks.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on HP or PP.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spend EXP on weapon skills.</span><br><br>[[ 3 ]]<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Canderence. “If the system is being abused, why don’t you cancel the bounty?”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Canderence. “You have to be in Averron to add to the trust, right?”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Canderence. “You and your lieutenant are a part of this too?”</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.
