Everyone who helped claim it should have an equal share in upgrading it.<br>Celestial Gems are just to rare to do it on our own.<br><br>At the moment I just think we should just repair our broken gear.<br>Research how to uncurse our equipment. This I assume we can find out by asking a few of our friends or searching through the forums.<br>That way we have an enchanted bastard sword and very decent armor.<br><br>After that is taken care of we can identify our loot, sell what we don't need, restock on healing items, and collect our share of the Observatory's profits.<br><br>With our shopping done for now we can head to the main city to see how things are there and use the fortune teller. Etc.<br><br>Then of course we can head back to the Observatory, because I assume our next goal will be fighting the spider boss with whatever help we can get.<br>We can check on the forge then and see if the forge master has made any progress in his research.<br>We can decide on if we want to change our equipment then.<br><br>Personally I'm fine with anything as long as it fits out skillset.","time":1483366830000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/2/17(Mon)9:20","id":"RPELy6Zi","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
