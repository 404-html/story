Most of our levels have been placed in defensive traits, our equipment is defense focused, and we have tanked the dangers instead of killing them before they kill us.<br><br>You want heavy mobile armor? You don't need to spend gems on it, those kinds of effects fall under crafting and proper choice of materials and enchantments.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">>Alright you prefer different things that's okay. I prefer passive constant bonus that you don't have to pay for necessarily. </span><br>Did you not read \"Not necessarily active\"? Active in this instance means abilities that you turn \"on\" to receive their effects. There are tons of defensive passives that gems can provide that are better than the standard +++defense, because that's what equipment ALREADY does WITHOUT gems. If anything, your focus on mobility is taking away from the defensive effects we could be getting.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">>You're assuming things won't carry over, A set that compliments each other. And the clashes that's the point of spending the gems, so the clashing is negated and only the positives exist and are enhanced.</span><br>\"clashes\" are not negative. It means that they do not compliment each other, that their abilities are not compatible nor work together to achieve the same goals. To spend gems to change that would mean changing what the items do in the first place. In which case: why don't you just use individual pieces that DO work together!?","time":1451027274000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/25/15(Fri)2:07","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
