I am placing more of an emphasis upon 'knight' 'knight, which, in this exercise, means someone whom protects their allies in battle. As this anon (<a href=\"#p37896344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37896344</a>) said, we'd rely primarily upon a superior weapon or other party members to really dish out the damage. Additionally, there is also the possibility that we might be able to use our shield to an offensive effect as well; in an earlier thread, someone mentioned possibly incorporating a cannon into our shield as well, and I quite like the idea of that, even if its possibility is suspect. Of course, I am under the thinking that weapons are not truly 'class locked' in a sense, since Nel uses knives, I believe, while being an explorer, and we use a pickaxe we looted from an explorer."}
