You can only assume Liza and Ayla are taking the hit as hard as you are; all of your other friends logged out shortly after you finished looting everything.<br><br>You loudly open the door and stumble over toward the kitchen. Eric’s door is open and the lights are off inside, but there’s a sizeable lump under a blanket on your living-room couch with a foot sticking out, sole pointed upwards, which you assume is him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Pour some water and start toasting a bagel while you root around in the fridge.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Head out somewhere for food.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Knock on Eric’s wall and peer inside.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Wake up the lump on your couch.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Play Broken Sky Online.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Other.</span>"}
