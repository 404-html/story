If I run, it will be on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, will start between 6 and 7 CST, and will have a warning on Twitter between thirty seconds to an hour in advance. Saturday threads can happen if my P&P falls through, but don't expect threads any other day.<br><br><a href=\"#p38122829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;38122829</a><br><a href=\"#p38122858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;38122858</a><br>I'm well aware. \"Begin\" is sort of a misleading statement. Ideally, the thread will begin with a post that's a bit longer than usual, and I'll wait a little while before asking for replies to that question in particular. I'm sure I'm just asking for the floodgates to be opened come that time, but I'll figure it out when necessary, and might even change things up a bit.","time":1424153305000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/17/15(Tue)1:08","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"1416284116421.jpg","fileSize":"919993 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38115464/images/1424153305197.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/38115464/thumbs/1424153305197s.jpg","md5":"JPxFP23QGX50nqe9s3HAAA==","w":"1250","h":"884","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"88"}
