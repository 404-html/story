But many of them would have had friends, parties or guilds before dying. Part of this is because they respawn somewhere random and can't use the game features to contact anyone, right? Once contact is made with other cities, we should help set up some sort of network to help them get back to potential allies. That way they're not joining Freakshow or something.
