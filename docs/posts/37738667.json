If you learned an ability called \"Power Attack\", I'm saying it would be evident what Level 2 Power Attack does--not that you'll necessarily know what lurks in the following levels of your masteries without diving in. There are some people who are very on the right track, so I know that this isn't all just coming out of left field.<br><br>Anything that seems nebulous isn't that way for no reason.</s>"}
