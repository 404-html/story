His evasiveness about asking how long we were in his place implies that he's probably not kept his PKing limited to nameless since he's upfront about that.<br><br>However, depending on his reaction we may well just be able to buddy it up with someone not afraid to get their hands dirty. Or we may have someone on our ass. Hell, if he's careful he might even pretend nothing's wrong til we return his creds.<br><br>But hopefully his reply will be telling of his position."}
