Considering their resources and the Observatory's status as the claimed hub nearest to the Earthsea, it's a no-brainer. I also think that our guildless group should invest the gems for our own ends individually unless we intend to form a guild of our own, in which case I'm all for using the gems on guild infrastructure upgrades."}
