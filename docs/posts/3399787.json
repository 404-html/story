Considering their resources and the Observatory&#039;s status as the claimed hub nearest to the Earthsea, it&#039;s a no-brainer. I also think that our guildless group should invest the gems for our own ends individually unless we intend to form a guild of our own, in which case I&#039;m all for using the gems on guild infrastructure upgrades.","time":1554169019000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/01/19(Mon)21:36:59","id":"eKqMaDoO","name":"Anonymous"}
