Imagine living every moment like that, never knowing if you're going to survive the next battle. Looking at the world from behind two shields.”<br><br>“You really think that appeals to someone?” Aelriss groans.<br><br>“I'm not gonna lie, I really want to meet him as a Nameless.” You say.<br><br>“Oh, don't even.” She sighs.<br><br>“Look, he was even in a guild!” You say, holding up his tabard.<br><br>“What was it called?” Aelriss asks.<br><br>“'Let's Get Weird'.” You say, holding it up to your own chest to judge the fit before stashing it in your Identifier.<br><br>“Wow.” She looks awestruck. “It's like you two were made for each other.”<br><br>“Yeaaah.

It's like he was incinerated.”<br><br>You'd bring up when she incinerated Kalim, the Nameless, with her own bird, but you don't think that'd make her happy. Tatsumaki's busy watching the two birds play; they seem to be getting along well. She seems mesmerized.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>"}
