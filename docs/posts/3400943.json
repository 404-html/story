Right now no one knows he&#039;s with us, so they&#039;re not going to make overtures to him to try and get him to doublecross us. Right now we also outnumber him and could easily gank his ass. That being said, his trustworthiness is in question, because when he finds out about our bounty he could easily message someone to coordinate a strike on our party.<br><br>He&#039;s valuable support and we need as much as we can get where we&#039;re going but we need to feel him out first. Let&#039;s do this by seeing how he reacts to meeting Freya. That ought to tell us whether he&#039;s in it to get money or if he&#039;s more willing to cooperate with buddies.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Current Party 4/5</span><br>-Ascheritte (Brawler, DPS)<br>-Nel (Explorer)<br>-Tatsumaki (Brawler, DPS)<br>-Cornelius (Artificer, Support)<br><br>The fortune teller told us previously, that we must bleed every drop of Tethiss&#039; blood from our veins if we hope to be judged fairly in her court. I think the best way to do this would be to have Freya sap us down to 1 health as soon as possible, and before heading into Tethiss&#039; Claw. A risky move, but I don&#039;t think any other way is going to cut it.","time":1554213408000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/02/19(Tue)09:56:48","id":"V2h2oypP","name":"Anonymous"}
