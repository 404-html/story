Only one use for concussive strike really sucks and I'm pretty sure Celestial Artifacts require PP to use. But think about this, those three points you want to use on shield skills could be used to max out either iron body or dodging and get the other one to level 2 of 3. Which would be way better than using a shield and having each skill at level one.","time":1450593669000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/20/15(Sun)1:41","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
