My party and I had a brief skirmish with him in the city, before the riots were over.”<br><br>“What? I don't believe it.” She folds her arms. “What happened?”<br><br>“He's powerful. Armed to the teeth with weapons and spells, and a katana that causes some sort of stunning effect on contact.” You respond. “In addition, he's wielding a Celestial Artifact that allows him to teleport at will.”<br><br>“Liza informed us. It's troubling. Do you know how far he can reach?” She asks.<br><br>“Far.” You respond. “I'm not sure what the limit is, or if he even has one. My party and I have been concerned, as he appears to be using it to orchestrate ambush groups.”<br><br>“We discussed the possibility.” Ayla responds. “The Guardians are fixated on driving Freakshow out of Averron, but we've elected not to move until we've reached a consensus. I'm trying to push for neutrality, but given I've been a part of more than one of their attacks now, I'm inclined to join the cause.”<br><br>“I don't think I'm in a position to arbitrate.” You nod.<br><br>“Right, then. What about Kjorikos?” She asks. “This, I want to hear.”<br><br>“He was the first Artificer, or some such. Condemned for supposedly heretical practices—something about pioneering 'aerheric' stuff?” A chill runs down your spine as you remember the fortune-teller's words. <br><br>“Aetheric...” Ayla says. “That's a word I want to hear right now. Go on.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Continued ]]</span>"}
