She's a control freak that is exactly what's she doing. After all she has to be in control to Beat Aniximander and the nameless.

Then you have CG outnumbered by non-CG.</span><br><br>There'd be so few DH and Wk there that she wouldn't let it happen. It wouldn't be \"fair\" to her people to have so little voice. After all this is one guild and since her makes up the majority by far player wise, she should be guild leader.<br><br><br>This is more or less a blatant powerplay so she can \"protect\" the city from itself for it's \"own good\"","time":1425366057000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/3/15(Tue)2:00","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
