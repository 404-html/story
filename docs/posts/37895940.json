That still, however, doesn't entirely answer the argument: why would we choose to specialize, at this point, when we could just as easily upgrade a skill that further increases our potency with any given weapon? I'm just not seeing the logic in the 'Saber/Two-Handed Mastery is better than Weapon Mastery' argument.<br><br>Additionally, it cannot be said that the 'bonuses', or whatever else you may choose to call them, necessarily outweigh whatever 'bonuses' we gain through Weapon Mastery, since we have literally no quantifiable evidence as to how much of a bonus each skill gives. Two-Handed mastery may open the path to more skills, yes, but we do not necessarily need Two-Handed Mastery to view effects of thosr skills. For instance, we can view Phantasm Strike, currently, despite not possessing its prerequisite ability.","time":1423296804000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/7/15(Sat)3:13","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
