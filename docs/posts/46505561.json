Do we have any new info?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( Nope. People are starting to think it’s some kind of event. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( They’re not overwhelmingly strong but there’s a –ton– of ‘em. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( They’re occupying some of the hunting grounds and I’m not sure when they plan on stopping. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: What do you think we should do?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( Not sure. There’s only so much difference a small group could make. Our expedition team especially isn’t suited for combat. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( And who knows if thinning the numbers will have an effect? )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( If they make it as far up as the Observatory, the sheer mass of players will rout them pretty easily. )</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Sulya ]]: ( I’d try to gather more information.
