I dunno. I only mentioned it because that's the only other possible way I can think of for the game to handle it while still letting you equip unidentified items. (Though thinking about it further, it could also give you a small flat penalty for using unidentified items but still let you use them for the sake of versatility.)<br><br>Either way, the main point is that it isn't as though the game prohibits us from using something just because it hasn't yet been identified, so if our scimitar doesn't seem to be helpful we shouldn't just call a full retreat."}
