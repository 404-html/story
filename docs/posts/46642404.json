The fortune-teller is nowhere to be seen. “Compare notes?”<br><br>“Yeah, sounds good.” Mendicant responds. “Tavern?”<br><br>“Hell with it.” Sven says. “Drinks on me.”<br><br>---<br><br>The tavern is a bit quieter now, and you’ve sit at the most secluded table available in the establishment; surprisingly, neither a roleplay group nor a hooded, brooding type waiting to be noticed has taken it over.<br><br>After a short wait, Sven arrives at the table, giving a curious look to the barmaid hanging onto his armored pauldron. Before long, she’s off, having brought and served his order; there’s a tall, frothing mug in front of each of the four of you, but he’s the only one doing a whole lot of drinking.<br><br>“So, what’d you guys see?” Sven asks.<br><br>“Rocks, and a whole lot of water.” Mendicant says. “Couple of royal-council looking types.
