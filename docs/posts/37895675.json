We realy shouldn't be getting abilities based off of simply 'muh pp' or not. Plus, Phantasmal Strike is pretty baller.<br><br>Anyways, I don't see a direct benefit to start using our pool, considering to get the best mileage out of it we'd need to invest into PP as well, which shouldn't be a priority because it doesn't necessarily directly affect our survivability. If we upgrade a pool, it should be HP for now. If we choose a skill, it should be either Lightning Reflexes or (wiser, imo) Weapon Mastery.","time":1423295551000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/7/15(Sat)2:52","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
