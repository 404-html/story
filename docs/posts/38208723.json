There's splashing and wingbeats from behind you, as the sliverwing gives chase. Their wings have a discomforting feathery texture, and leave something in the air like moth dust that stings your eyes.<br><br>Aelriss is ducking left and right, prodding with her staff, and Eunoia can't find an approach on either of the targets surrounding her. There's a faintly-glowing orange streak leading across the ground to her, and you can see the side of her face is burned pretty badly.<br><br>Well, at least she's good at dodging.

The bird whistles merrily, and the silverwing seizes before rolling to one side, the glow in its eyes growing dim. Paralysis.<br><br>You take the opportunity, and put your blade through its head.
