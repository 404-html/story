You get what you pay for.<br>I envisage it as midtier being good value for money, and that pressing higher than that would probably be horrendously expensive. Whether it would be a prudent move to pursue the benefits of high level time control at that stage in the quest or just shell out for a quick and shiny weapon artifact or something when we get that far is up to speculation.<br><br>The point though is that a time control artifact is one which would conceivably be a good gem dump at any tier. Something you know you're always gonna use, something that will always be useful in every combat situation (unless we somehow find a foe that only negates time manipulation but not gems in general?),<br><br><a href=\"#p44320651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44320651</a><br>Yeah, Tick Tock Tech Knight is a nice theme."}
