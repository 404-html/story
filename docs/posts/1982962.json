It’s not going to happen, and there’s no chance of getting a collaboration effort back together with Averron as it is.” Ayla says. “I’ve handed the project over to a tech called Baron. He’s good – just a little hard to talk to. But he’s got all my work, as well as the Hecatelia schematics and reports, which should be enough to get us as far as the Earthsea once we get a task force behind it.

Take on the real threat.”<br><br>“You can.
