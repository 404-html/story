They are a supportive archetype that can harness elemental abilities, as well as make powerful equipment to be used by themselves or others.<br>* Technician: The Technician is a supportive archetype that can create a variety of machines to serve in and out of combat. Dedicated Technicians can maximize the effectiveness of their abilities by choosing from one of a number of specializations.<br>Technicians not the same as artificer. I mean I am cool with just buying a weapon. And having npc's do it. but I think long run a player may provide us \"small\" bonuses that might add up. as they upgrade it.<br><s>that's assuming a lot though.</s><br><a href=\"#p37688649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37688649</a><br>I think we'd be better increasing our mastery to get a skill instead.<br>I say offensive and get abilities that will let us destroy enemies before they can score hits.<br>Like what we did in our first battle.<br>Also armor should help with that.<br>But since we're going to a tavern anyway.
