She then proceeded to betray the Observers by closing the seal which implies that she played a role in opening it in the first place. So both the celestials and the observers hate her now which puts her in a really bad spot. My take is that we need to discuss things with her to get the whole picture. I'd even say that inviting her on this next foray into the fire area would be a good idea."}
