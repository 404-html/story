'pegasus gilded mail'?” You ask.<br><br>“Ah, an interesting type of armor.” He says. “It augments the inertia of its wearers, but it's no good if you're too heavy to get moving.”<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Forge a Pegasus Cuirass for 250 credits – [[ + Damage Reduction ]] [[ + Power Charge ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Forge a Pegasus Full Plate for 250 credits, gilded armor scraps – [[ ++ Damage Reduction ]] [[ - Mobility ]] [[ + Power Charge ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Ask what you can do with onyx shards.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Sell other weapons or armor.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Search for another weapon to buy.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Ask about an item.</span>","time":1424138436000,"time4chanFormatted":"2/16/15(Mon)21:00","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"}
