I love it all, of course - but obviously I want to depart from my inspirations (but also to invoke similar feelings - to create similar intrigue) and I'm still going through the very slow process of figuring out what exactly that's going to look like. How much goes on in real life is obviously directly related to how much time you guys spend outside the game - and I mean, our protagonist doesn't really have a whole lot going on for him right this minute.</s><br><br><a href=\"#p554948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;554948</a><br><s>Guys!
