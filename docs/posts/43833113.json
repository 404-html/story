It's much larger than you; even if you cover a great distance while it's burrowing, the geometry of the whole thing works out such that it can still emerge from directly under you. You're not sure how much damage a “bite” from the thing would deal—but you can't imagine it would be a pretty outcome.<br><br>You jump free of the burrower's body and land on the curved stone wall, making your way upward. You have time to move freely while you can still see the back half of its body above ground, and you utilize it as best you can, scrambling up the side of the maw back toward the crumbling terrace, now high overhead. Stones fall past, and you make sure you're shielded; then, the Chthonic vanishes, but you can feel it moving underground.<br><br>You wait, monitoring its intensity intuitively, then leap back downward once you have the opportunity. As calculated, it bursts from the earth in the space you once occupied, and flies high across the maw, leaving a newly-formed chasm in its wake. Now's your chance.
