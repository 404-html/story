{"number":"2002833","threadNumber":"1978591","comment":"So I feel like the lifedrain ability that Freya has sounds similar to how the Observers drained the powers of the celestials before defeating them. Freya's power doesn't just drain health, it seems to also transfer some kind of other essence or abilities from the target to the recipient since it jacked us into the Telthiss hivemind. We need to talk to her about the origin of her powers, I'm a bit confused about what exactly it is since I'd be surpirsed if a celestial artifact could have Observer powers.","time":1508792794000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/23/17(Mon)17:06","id":"sulWMYcI","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
