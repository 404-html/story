If it can even be fixed, I'm guessing it'll have something to do with laser beams...”<br><br>“Laser beams? Oh, shit.” Vyx asks. “Never mind, put me back in too.”<br><br>“Does anyone even care?” Kainzo asks. The response is overwhelmingly apathetic.<br><br>“I'd probably just give it to someone more suited.” Andor says. “So count me out if that matters.”<br><br>“He broke it.” Dorian frowns, seeming fixated on this. “I'd want it otherwise.”<br><br>“Laser beams.” Vyx gives a wistful sigh. “Hehe.”<br><br>“Okay, fine, whatever.” Kainzo seems completely exasperated, rolling his eyes as he goes through the next set of motions. “Ayla, sending it your way. I'll be distributing the Gems now, as well. Make sure I've got everything right, now.”<br><br>You check your inventory—yes, another Celestial Gem.
