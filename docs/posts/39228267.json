Looks like there's a couple of little places. This one looks like a lady's room. Frilly... bunch of empty portraits.”<br><br>“Empty...” The room is dark, with a lace-curtained canopy bed occupying the majority of the floor space.

There was a woman in the one I had, though...”<br><br>“You have more art from this place?” Ayla asks. “Could I take a look at it?”<br><br>“Well, I already sold it when we went back to town...” Aeriss shrugs.<br><br>“You... sold it?” Ayla looks distraught.<br><br>“Yeah? People are just gonna put the stuff in their houses.” Aelriss says. “You can just buy it back later... it's probably not going anywhere.
