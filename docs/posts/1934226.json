There's tons of smaller trade guilds right now that won't be involved in the merger. If we make our own merger of those guilds we can gain influence and have a system of checks and balances to keep Liza's power in check. Plus streamlining the economy and industry could help us make more progress toward a working excavator. I don't think making a guild just to be antagonistic toward the Alliance would be productive.<br><a href=\"#p1934214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1934214</a><br>The thing is that the merger might actually be a good thing, consolidating the more powerful guilds into a stronger guild before we have to start competing or cooperating with other cities. We just can't let it become totalitarian","time":1507249216000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/5/17(Thu)20:20","id":"Qfrb6/k9","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
