She wouldn't be asking to \"trim the fat\" so her people outnumber all the others. She's a known control freak with a grudge against freakshow's leader. The grudge was so abd she fucked over city defense and put other guilds in jeopardy so her people wouldn't \"get in the way.\" Additionally her actions left her guild at 100% strength while the other bigger guilds took losses and smaller guilds got wiped out. How is any of this illogical to you?"}
