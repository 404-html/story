She is more capable than the lesser araneids – and weaves shadow magic like her own viziers. They organize themselves through a hive-mind connected to her.” The fortune-teller says, nodding sagely at you. “She knows you have stolen from her, Ascheritte. You must bleed every drop of her life from your body if you wish to be judged fairly in her court.”<br><br>“…What?”<br><br>“The silk of araneids is a useful crafting material, as it is very light but surprisingly strong when properly worked. It would be worthwhile to collect some if you wish to expand your wardrobe. The araneids will utilize their own silk to craft ranged weapons, as well as pitfall traps. Be wary of those, as well as the true spiders who live commensally with araneids, if you seek to traverse the Claw.”<br><br>Reposting to refresh everyone's memories."}
