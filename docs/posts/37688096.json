You'll recognize them, as they're humanoid, but not human.” The guardsman nods. “They handle all of the activities that are true cred-sinks, like starting guilds and purchasing food and starter gear. There's also some quest-givers; all the NPCs seem killable, but we're abiding by a policy not to. They've got enormous HP totals, and we haven't determined whether or not they're a renewable resource.”<br><br>“I see. What's down below?” You ask. “Dungeons?”<br><br>“Something like that.” He says. “I've been down once or twice—there's cave systems populated with monsters, as well as a bunch of lost city, temple-esque stuff. The Writ Keepers have a thread up on one of the message boards theorizing that all of this is a lower stratum, a world that sank from up above, but there's no way to know without exploring more down there.
