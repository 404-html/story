Sorry if I'm being annoying everyone.<br><br>Earthsea Lore:<br><br>The Observers drove everyone underground and then punished the Earthsea because society as a whole was becoming too powerful. They used the King of the Earthsea as a vessel (similarly to how Cidren seemed to have an Observer or at least one of their Guardians inside of him)<br><br>After everyone was driven underground the Earthsea served as a focal point for everyone to meet up and make progress. The Observers got pissed again and then sealed the Earthsea to split all the different cities and slow their progress toward returning to the surface again. <br><br>The king went kinda crazy and cast out a shitload of his people, creating the earthsea exiles. Some of those went on to become troglodytes while others became beasts like the araneids. The kingâ€™s closest followers (such as Cidren) were empowered by the observers to help keep the humans entombed beneath the surface. <br><br>Kjorikos once lived in the Earthsea but managed to escape on his own terms. He was never involved with the Observers like other precursors are."}
