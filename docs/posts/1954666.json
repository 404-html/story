I don't want to get wrapped up in guild politics and I don't want to bother dealing with guild management. I don't want to get sidetracked by being committed to a guild's interests unless those interests are exactly our own. If we do anything guild related, I think it should be the creation of a \"we were all partying together anyways guild\" simply for the sake of being a unified group explicitly."}
