Your trophy of conquest, the Aura Brush, stains the world blood-red with confidence, passion, and inner fire. You move with great speed around the courtyard’s outer ring—an aged cobble path—leaving glossy orbs in your wake that drift about slowly, aimlessly, before setting their sights upon the Lotus King and homing in at incredible speed.<br><br>Violent explosions ripple outward, swatches across the monastery courtyard. You hear an unearthly howling as tendrils are severed and flowers burn, enormous petals from the King’s apex bloom shedding and fluttering gently to the ground. The courtyard is ablaze, your prey hidden behind a wall of orange smoke. It smells somewhat like a fireplace in wintertime.<br><br>An acceptable underpainting, but it needs something more, you think. The ensemble is missing a personal touch.<br><br>The limbs of the Lotus King burst out of the cloud, rearing upward before closing in on you.","time":1451003091000,"time4chanFormatted":"12/24/15(Thu)19:24","id":null,"name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"2141829515.jpg","fileSize":"26773 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/44363193/images/1451003091630.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/44363193/thumbs/1451003091630s.jpg","md5":"h4q1PAJo/v7g79g5HGXH/g==","w":"490","h":"368","tn_w":"125","tn_h":"93"}
