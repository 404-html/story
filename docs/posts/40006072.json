Still sends a chill down your spine, too, with consistency that makes you wonder if it's somehow a simulated event. You're not even sure why you've elected to hold onto it this long, for that matter: intimidated, perhaps, into a frightened sense of duty to rescue the immortal soul of a virtual ghost and free yourself from a curse that you're not even sure will have any real effect on your well-being, in and out of Broken Sky.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: Fuck.
