You never know when we'll next face down an awesome boss that we really want the memory of, only to find we've got full slots.<br><br>This problem is exacerbated by the fact we can invest CGs into certain memories. The more we invest in our current ones, the less likely we're going to be able to justify swapping them down the line for more powerful or versatile memories."}
