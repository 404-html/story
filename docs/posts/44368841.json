Meaning we could create \"heavy armor\" Thats several inchs thick, that is as light as leather, and provides the same mobility, if not a speed buff/or strength. And doesn't hinder movement. Not saying that the armor is going to cost 1 celestial gem. but You get what you pay for.<br><a href=\"#p44368800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;44368800</a><br>I agree, but mobility is something we should be keen on keeping. Since we utilize it well in battle. I am not much for getting a shield myself."}
