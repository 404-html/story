It's his primary mode of attack and offers a number of unique utilities, while still having its own related limitations, and he's foregone upgrading weapon and class skills in order to have the requisite PP to potentially wield one or more Artifacts while still feasibly doing \"artificer things\".<br><br>A reasonably-costed starter Artifact won't drown you in terms of commit cost, but things like HP and PP are typically do-no-wrong in terms of putting points into them as you gain levels. And Ascheritte will probably be gaining levels more regularly again pretty soon."}
