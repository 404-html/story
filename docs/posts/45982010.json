I also do not think that the bracers would be anywhere near as useful as some suspect due to the cavernous nature of this zone.<br><br>Of the current suggestions, the timepiece is what I think the best because of the fact it's obviously a top tier artifact with massive growth potential and useful in every possible fight ever, plus whilst it's nowhere near as exotic as that guy's paintbrush, say, it doesn't go too far in the other direction and change the nature of the quest.<br><br>That aside, stop me if I'm wrong, but a lucerne is spike and hammer right? I'd have said a pollaxe with slash and hammer would be a better choice if you're looking for type flexibility. (And no, using a lucerne with a sword DOESN'T count for that, since it's markedly more cumbersome to shuffle your weapons than it is to swivel it.
