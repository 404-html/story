Maybe the celestial relics like the Last Argument were the original iteration of celestial artifacts that we use today and Precursors were originally other players. But that's pure speculation. The only clue we've had about Observers is when we described ourself as a \"formless Observer\" during our Earthsea vision with the fortune teller, maybe there's a link there?<br><br>My other theory is that BSO is actually an alternate dimension but that one's pretty crazy."}
