What if we also made it into a pseudo-religious group, reaffirming faith to the celestials and creating some hallowed ground to defend. It makes sense because the celestials and observers are naturally opposed to one another. Plus we could become a holy order of paladins which would be great.","time":1507947898000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/13/17(Fri)22:24","id":"VhuUbbcO","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
