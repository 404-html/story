As a brawler, we're automatically proficient with any kind of weapon -- we're the same class as Tatsu, in fact. The reason I want them over the shitty dagger is because, if we have to resort to the dagger, that means we've already broken a weapon, or have already been disarmed. Now, it's rather difficult to disarm someone wearing gauntlets, and these gauntlets also do not have the -Durability of the dagger."}
