Protective gear helps both Players and Nameless, we make spars less hostile and more educational, encourage betting with gems constructively instead of banning stuff nofunallowed, we don't tell people what kind of Aethersteel gear they can make, we open up entirely new modes of transport like riding laserhorses, and you can even be a fucking jedi.</span><br>That does sound more interesting than what the other guy is spouting.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I'll level with you: that sounds like the complete opposite of fun.
