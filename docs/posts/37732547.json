As you begin cycling through your inventory, you recall the guardsman you met mentioning “cred-sinks”. It's unlikely that any player other than the newest would want any of the junk you're hauling around, but his statement implied that money delivered to NPCs leaves the economy—so much of what you've seen thus far involves players purchasing things from other players, whereas selling items to NPCs and finding loot in dungeons dumps credits into the economy...
