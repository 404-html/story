Your artifact chirps, offering an ensemble of bright, mechanical whines and clicks as it unfolds into a grid of light orbited by pixilate cubes.<br><br>In the space between this world and the next, you can see parasites: paradoxical creatures of light and dark, subjugating gods from their unseen place. They crawl toward you, endless in number, subsuming the thread that connects you to this font of Celestial power. Your eye twitches as memories that are not yours are envisaged within; your head aches as though your thoughts have been split open, forced to fit volumes of unfamiliar text.<br><br>You know now that should you fail to master these memories, you will become as their conduit: the hand through which they may act once again, to succeed where they once failed. Once you accept this Celestial eye, there will be no going back. This is the price of an eye that sees the past.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Accept the power of the Celestial eye.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sever the thread.</span>","time":1554328885000,"time4chanFormatted":"04/03/19(Wed)18:01:25","id":"UY4d4r9X","name":"Sylv","trip":"!!osgMMlm58hs","filename":"JD1HZy.jpg","fileSize":"127782 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/images/1554328885479.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/3395258/thumbs/1554328885479s.jpg","md5":"nLjEcxRGOwVrQ6BX7mGvtA==","w":1000,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100}
