You make your way into one of the caves, ducking off the main path. Through the distant fog, you can hear the skittering of Crawlers.<br><br>Inside, it's quiet. The air is a bit dry, and the cave walls wash from blue to brown. The light dies from outside quickly. There isn't much luminescence here, neither the glowing quartzite slabs above the Ancient Cathedral, nor the mysterious ubiquitous light that renders Averron City and the surrounding caves visible.<br><br>A distance ahead, you can see the cave drops off a cliff, but the abyss below is black, rather than white. There's cracks in the stone on the edge where it looks like climbing harnesses might have been set up some time in the past. It's quiet below.<br><br>There's a dead player lying off to the side.
