We need to have a prolonged discussion with Freya at some point.<br><br>I don't know for sure where she initially got her artifact, if you can even call her life draining hand an artifact, but she definitely initially worked with Cidren who was empowered and morphed into a beast by the Observers. In the end she helped us defeat what seemed to be an observer or at least an observer-serving guardian that burst out of Cidren. And I get the feeling that she genuinely cares for the well-being of the Nameless. I really can't get a solid read on her motivations though.<br><br>I can't say I trust Smith at all though. He's fully against the message we've tried to bring concerning cooperation between nameless and identified players due to his murderboner. Considering the amount of UIs he had accrued he might even be a killer of identified players.","time":1507510101000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/8/17(Sun)20:48","id":"Qfrb6/k9","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
