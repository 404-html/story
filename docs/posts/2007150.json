This is probably how all of Nel's friends have been dying <s>NEL IS A SERVANT OF THE OBSERVERS, SETTING PLAYERS UP TO BE KILLED AS THEY LOG ON</s>. Not everyone is going to suddenly start dying, but it's a thing that is actually happening and raising tension.<br><br>Yes, the Observers probably have more forces ready to throw at us. We might not be ready to take them on as individuals. But if they send them at us in a straight fight, they don't have the advantages a Dungeon affords, and they have to face a full population of players, not small groups that have been further reduced by said picking off of players.<br><br><br>We're not an organized army like Hecatelia, but I'm not so certain we're ever going to GET like that, not in an acceptable span of time. Nobody wants Lyza's elitism, and I got basically no support to equip everyone in aethersteel. If we're not going to purposely bump up everyone's strength through politics or economics, just letting the status quo continue could get more people killed in the long run.<br><br>Again, I'm not saying we should do the event right this moment, but I'm not even sure how far back you're arguing to push this issue. We're IN a dungeon right now. We're not likely to just pack up and leave because we got a great idea, let's start an event.","time":1508892351000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/24/17(Tue)20:45","id":"kM/5uzUA","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
