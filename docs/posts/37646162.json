They are masters of all melee weapons, as well as unarmed fighting. A Brawler is capable of absorbing damage, and can move around the battlefield rapidly and unpredictably.<br>* Gunner: Gunners specialize in ranged combat.

They are a supportive archetype that can harness elemental abilities, as well as make powerful equipment to be used by themselves or others.<br>* Technician: The Technician is a supportive archetype that can create a variety of machines to serve in and out of combat. Dedicated Technicians can maximize the effectiveness of their abilities by choosing from one of a number of specializations.<br>* Explorer: The Explorer is a supportive archetype with the tools for survival.
