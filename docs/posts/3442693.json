In fact, in an ideal world, we would take that lesser art before facing the memory, because then I’m pretty sure we’d keep that lesser art while still unlocking new ones. <br><br>Unfortunately I think that also means we missed out on the passive buffs that one trait from Exile was offering. On the other hand, the wording of both of these examples specifically calls out their associated memory, and Exile’s name changed to Throne. Somehow I doubt Sylv would let investiture go to waste though."}
