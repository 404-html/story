Your cloak—taken from the stockpile of the mad Artificer Kjorikos—rests fluttering on your shoulders, hood pulled over your head. The rings of your gilded mail clink quietly as you come to rest. Your body is crackling with malefic energy.<br><br>You are standing near the table you were seated at when you last logged out. Crow, Aelriss, Tatsumaki, and Smith are nowhere to be seen – but you feel as if someone is staring at you. You look around to pinpoint the source, unsure of whether or not this sensation is more profound than a mere feeling after what you just went through.<br><br>The NPCs – the beast-kin shopkeepers and attendants of the Observatory – usually regard you as their Keeper, welcoming you with open arms.
