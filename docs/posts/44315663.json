Don't worry, though,” She says. “There's always next time.”<br><br>“Why are you so happy?” You ask.<br><br>“Cause,” Vyx laughs, then springs to her feet, posing with both of her guns held high. “I'm a proper member of the Crimson Guardians! It's hype as fuck, and I don't know what to do about it. Apparently, they liked me. Who'd have thought?”<br><br>“Dunno. I've got the feeling they hate me.” You say. “At least, Kainzo does.”<br><br>“Oh, well, he's a pain in the dick anyway.” She shrugs. “I bugged him from the start—he says I get bored easily, and I'm like, yeah, like everyone playing this game.

You did fine.” Vyx falls backwards, rolling over in the grass. “People are gonna have high emotions. So don't pressure yourself about it.”<br><br>You begin again, but feel it'd somehow be wrong of you to interrupt her continued laughter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chat with Dorian.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Leave the overworld simulation.</span>","filename":"Vyx.jpg","fileSize":"208 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44309252/images/1450760887542.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/44309252/images/1450760887542s.jpg","md5":"Ola4Jmob4YU3iVAHN+/ntA==","w":836,"h":1558,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125}
