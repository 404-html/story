And the Disposable Heroes are super-casual, I thought.” You ask. “How is that going to work?”<br><br>“It's not, which is why I'm against it—though it might be the best thing to do on behalf of the rest of the players, given my role in the hierarchy.” Ayla frowns. “My guild would likely lose almost all of its membership. Likewise, the metaphorical fat would be trimmed from Disposable Heroes. The ideologies of the individual guilds would have to be done away with to benefit the group.”<br><br>“What about the Guardians?”<br><br>She pauses, continuing with a sigh. “The merger would leave us a council, of the players that are either the strongest or the most fit to lead.”<br><br>The conversation stalls.<br><br>“It's just talk,” Ayla says. “So don't go telling all of your friends, alright? I mean it.”<br><br>You nod.","time":1425362870000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/3/15(Tue)1:07","id":null,"name":"Sylvetica","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY"}
