You conquer stronger opponents and cast yourself into battle for the prize of Celestial Gems. *That* is what you do, and something within you demands more as you reach for the altar.<br><br>“I’m good.” You respond. “Might have to take a message in just a second, though.”<br><br>“I’m eager to get back topside, myself.” Cornelius says, working with his menu.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ UI Messenger – Kinoue ]]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Yeah, that’s me.
