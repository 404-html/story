Sybil already doesn't feel like it's just a \"game\" anymore, yet they keep coming back for more. They can't help it. And it's ideas like that, the disorientation, the nausea, perhaps even a touch of horror, that I'd love to see more of, and it necessitates learning a little more about who the people are outside of the game for it to have any impact.<br><br>Then again, I also think it's interesting how certain characters might not think of themselves as being 'all that interesting' outside of the game, especially Roleplayers or people playing from a hospital bed. Their time online, for them, is basically just as important as their time offline. Maybe moreso."}
