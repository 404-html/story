{"number":"555024","threadNumber":"550943","comment":"<a href=\"#p554977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;554977</a><br>The thing I like about Broken Sky Online is that there's so much raw potential, but it seems like from a quest standpoint, the only part that gets explored in any real detail are the \"game\" portions, even though obviously much more is going on. Sybil already doesn't feel like it's just a \"game\" anymore, yet they keep coming back for more. They can't help it. And it's ideas like that, the disorientation, the nausea, perhaps even a touch of horror, that I'd love to see more of, and it necessitates learning a little more about who the people are outside of the game for it to have any impact.<br><br>Then again, I also think it's interesting how certain characters might not think of themselves as being 'all that interesting' outside of the game, especially Roleplayers or people playing from a hospital bed. Their time online, for them, is basically just as important as their time offline. Maybe moreso.","time":1473578041000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/11/16(Sun)3:14","id":"P96o7nY7","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
