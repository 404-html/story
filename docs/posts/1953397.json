I think a fleetfoot skill would be nice for damage avoidance or increasing movement speed to make better use of our inertia charge. But I'd also like a point going into the greatsword skill. And our HP and PP could both be higher. I'm curious to see how they compare to others at our level. The less responsible choice would be to get another combat skill like concussive strike which would be fun but probably not the wisest choice right now.","time":1507691553000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/10/17(Tue)23:12","id":"3s8dGgyZ","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
