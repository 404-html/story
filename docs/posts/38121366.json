Can you access the message boards? ))</span><br><br>You check.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Nope, why?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( God damnit. There was a battle in the tavern. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( A rogue Tech detonated a fractalline array bomb, claiming it was to 'disperse the fighting'. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( It killed four Nameless, two other players, did enough damage to take down the NPC bartender... ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: What? Holy shit.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( That's not the worst part. It destroyed the message board server. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Yeah, I was thinking earlier: should that really be in the tavern?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( Fuck no. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( If we can get another one online, we're putting it in the Guardians' guild hall. But, I've cannibalized everything I could, and it doesn't look like that's happening for a while. Information flow regarding new items and the dungeon branches has gone full stop, and city-wide communication is a pipe-dream, even with the ansible. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: Seriously? What do you need?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( Luck, or interference to the tune of Celestial Gems. A cursory look at the parts reveals that these things are made of stuff we haven't discovered yet. Like Unique Identifiers. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ayla ]]: (( If you want to talk lore, I'll be at the Hall later, or you can go find Dorian there now. He'll chat you up if it's really that important. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> [[ Ascheritte ]]: You were the one down in the ruins with me. I doubt anyone else would get it.</span><br><br>There's no further response for a bit.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">> Message Aelriss or Tatsumaki and find out where they've gone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">> Head for the guild halls.
