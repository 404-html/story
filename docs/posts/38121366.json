I just got a couple of consultations done, and the results were a little bit weird.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Oh, are we interested in the lore now? ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Ha ha. Are you busy?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Very, actually. Can you access the message boards? ))</span><br><br>You check.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Nope, why?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( God damnit. There was a battle in the tavern. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( A rogue Tech detonated a fractalline array bomb, claiming it was to 'disperse the fighting'. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( It killed four Nameless, two other players, did enough damage to take down the NPC bartender... ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: What? Holy shit.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( That's not the worst part. It destroyed the message board server. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Yeah, I was thinking earlier: should that really be in the tavern?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Fuck no. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( If we can get another one online, we're putting it in the Guardians' guild hall. But, I've cannibalized everything I could, and it doesn't look like that's happening for a while. Information flow regarding new items and the dungeon branches has gone full stop, and city-wide communication is a pipe-dream, even with the ansible. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Seriously? What do you need?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( Luck, or interference to the tune of Celestial Gems. A cursory look at the parts reveals that these things are made of stuff we haven't discovered yet. Like Unique Identifiers. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ayla ]]: (( If you want to talk lore, I'll be at the Hall later, or you can go find Dorian there now. He'll chat you up if it's really that important. ))</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: You were the one down in the ruins with me. I doubt anyone else would get it.</span><br><br>There's no further response for a bit.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Message Aelriss or Tatsumaki and find out where they've gone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Head for the guild halls. You could talk to Dorian, wait for Ayla, or knock on the Guardians' door.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Continue to the city center.</span>","filename":"Ayla.jpg","fileSize":"95 KB","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/38115464/images/1424148894753.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/38115464/images/1424148894753s.jpg","md5":"5XvLlrBnZqiUZB8+iQY06w==","w":565,"h":800,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125}
