They're cross about logistics, it seems; losing the best 'benefits' because they made a mistake? What are they even on about, you wonder? Perhaps there were other subscription plans “I just logged on for the first time, and your friend tried to kill me. I don't have a clue what's going on, and I'm paying a monthly fee, too! I didn't know this game was available for free...”<br><br>“Yeah, right! It'll take us forever to meet up with him again!” The braided boy hefts his pick onto one shoulder, glaring at you. From a bag on his shoulder, he produces a beaten and cracked piece of technology. You recognize it, but the lit band that should run its width is dented and shut off. A broken Unique Identifier, like the one mounted on your waist. “We're just evening the scales. When we kill you, you'll lose your UI, and that's it—no contacts, no inventory, no name. You won't even get to find a Celestial Gem before you lose your chance.”<br><br>Is that it, then? Your Unique Identifier must be your menu of sorts—which means these lot have to carry their equipment themselves, keep in contact by normal or external means, and assign names themselves.
