Surely there’s a reason.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: It was originally… exposure. But it got out of hand.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Exposing what? I haven’t really done anything.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Lemme explain. Give the forum thread a read «here» and I’ll give you the condensed version.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Now, this isn’t something with proof we can consult, because most every witness is dead, fair warning.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Here’s what happens. Group of four people, an Explorer and Tech from the Talents, and two hunter-trader types they picked up at the Observatory, head down to one of the safe gathering areas on a little resource expedition.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: It’s «this» spot?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: I’m reading, one sec.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: That’s straight above the Rift. Is that really a safe area?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: There are confirmed no monster spawns in the whole zone.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Anyway, they’re just picking up materials, when a squad of monsters comes in all the way from Tethiss’s Claw.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Two araneid soldiers and two araneid viziers—those are spellcasters, by the way.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: Why didn’t they fight? Try to run, or something?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: Ascheritte, the average BSO player is not like you. Spellcasting mobs are rare. Usually seeing just one in a normal hunting ground is occasion to run.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: They did run. All of them still died except the Explorer.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Ascheritte ]]: So what does this have to do with me.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; [[ Head Hunter Canderence ]]: The Araneids were supposedly chanting ‘Ascheritte’ the whole time. Something like ‘bring us Ascheritte’. </span><br><br>You are at full health.
