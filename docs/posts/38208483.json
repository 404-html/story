It's skittering forward, scythe-like legs covered in chitinous armor. It's got enormous wings, and its abdomen resembles a bioluminescent, bulbous sac, webbed in bony armor plating.<br><br>You stride backwards, water and mud splashing from underfoot as you ready your bastard sword against the charge. It rears up, mouthparts clicking, hoping to impale you on one of its razor-sharp forelimbs, but makes the mistake of exposing the underbelly.<br><br>You stab it from beneath, and carry through, watching your sword emerge from its back as it towers over you, and cutting clean between the wings from head to tail.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ascheritte defeated sliverwing.

A reverberation echoes through the cave, and bits of rock fall from above.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Tatsumaki defeated sliverwing.

The air is filled with an acrid stench, and you'd swear from the heat it was combusting on contact with oxygen.
