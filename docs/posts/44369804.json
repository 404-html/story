It's a dumb idea and incredibly CG wasteful. We could do better with time stop (better dodge, dps and being able to evade and navigate far faster than we should), spirit channeling (flight, earth walk, water walk, iron skin at 100, wind walk, phasing etc.), or several other abilities tied to a High end artifact for the same cost. That'd also eat less PP and make it so we can change out armor when we find better. You're trying to stop us ever throwing gear away or selling gear off, which is core MMO and stupid as hell."}
