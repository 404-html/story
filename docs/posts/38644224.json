So we've got the choice of fighting it on the stairs or in the labyrinth.<br><br>The labyrinth had constructs milling about the last time we were there right? I'm thinking stairs is by far the better option, hell we might even be able to force it off and down it with fall damage.<br><br>I have a feeling that Ayla's bombs are liable to shattering the glass so getting her to hold off on using those is probably a good idea.<br><br>Besides, then we can lob them down at it if it falls through by itself.<br><br>If we get an opportune moment we might wanna see what loot the initial enemies had on them in case they have something heavy we can stick in our UI, run up the stairs, and then take out and throw down. That'd give Nel something to do at any rate.","time":1426139857000,"time4chanFormatted":"3/12/15(Thu)1:57","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
