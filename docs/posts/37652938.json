Your UI just sort of absorbs the items; you can't describe how you're interfacing with them, just sort of tucking them away. <br><br>Which brings to mind the issue of storing containers in containers; the purist in you wonders why your UI didn't just explode, either from storing bags in it, or from storing other UIs in it.<br><br>Either way, it doesn't look like there's an explicit limit on your carrying capacity; despite that, there's no way this game would let you carry around infinite shit.
