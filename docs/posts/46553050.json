That doesn't even count what happens if a Identified bites it from bad luck or betrayal. At that point it'd be giving them all the more reason to take what they know, both politically, information, and experience wise over. The Writ Keepers alone have VERY good role play oriented players who are dangerous and skilled. You need to MAJORLY rethink you approach. I'm saying this as a guy who got jumped by three Nameless with killing intent the moment I spawned. As it stands it looks like the Crimson Guardians are making an elitist powerplay to take the city and \"cleanse\" the nameless. That will lead to civil war on the level that make our previous debacle look tame."}
