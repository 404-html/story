He was still involved with the celestial gods but branded as a heretic for his work trying to revive his lost waifu. Cidren was granted power by the observers and was transformed by it. Also based on Kjorikos' conversation with us in this thread I don't think he was aligned with the observers.","time":1507512027000,"time4chanFormatted":"10/8/17(Sun)21:20","id":"Qfrb6/k9","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
