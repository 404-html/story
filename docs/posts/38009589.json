Even with eye-witnesses, it still falls upon the word-of-mouth of untrustworthy folk. The Alliance were sworn not to act in this matter, instead choosing to maintain peace, a peace which Liza herself has broken!\"<br><br>Liza's grip on her weapon tightens. She doesn't respond, and Anaximander continues.<br><br>\"I'm ashamed, Liza. As an Alliance leader, you should set an example for others. Instead, you've chosen to overstep your boundaries. You've defied the principles you've forced the players in this city to obey! You've broken the peace you've established!\" He shouts. \"And, you've chosen to act as a free agent! A coward! You are no Guardian!\"<br><br>Welp, that did it; you see her eyebrow twitch, and her spear flares. She settles on her back leg.
