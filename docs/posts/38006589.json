Weapon skills and passive boosting abilities don't influence DCs; they actually just add stacking positive modifiers to all of your relevant rolls. I've thought about displaying those but I don't want to encounter any future trouble with consistency or potential upset if I ever have to change the mechanics or numbers.</s>"}
