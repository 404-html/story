If Liza has plurality and majority(she will), she could set this up however she wants. She'd push for mixed teams and her guys would agree. DH and WK wouldn't be able to resist. Then she'd turn who she could and off who she couldn't. The initial set up doesn't matter cause the mid and endgame are so fucking telegraphed it's painful."}
