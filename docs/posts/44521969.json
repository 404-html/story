Early levels it'd be really useful for support functions, since Asche is already pretty good at direct combat.<br>Later levels we'd be able to pact with heavy hitters maybe? Plot wise and for developing the story, I think it's the most interesting option.","time":1451753940000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/2/16(Sat)11:59","id":null,"name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
