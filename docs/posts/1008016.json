Pale aethersteel warhammer, that's it. I'd rather something that we can reliably wield, and the buildpath I want does not include raw strength in a timely manner.<br>Obviously try out the fluxsabre, but it will probably be the next weapon replaced due to the unreliability.<br><br>Otherwise, focus on melting down or repairing our junk to make better armor. Maybe look into armor that gives status resist, jesus fuck. Curse resist might be too pricey if it even exists, though.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">>Guild Politics</span><br>I'm for making our own guild. No sense biting off more than we can chew, with all the drama. Angling for Aetherforged, unless anyone has other specific themes in mind.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">>Overall Plan</span><br>Just sort out Observatory policies and everything. Gotta make sure things don't go to the shitter the moment we log off. Also, check out that simulation place to see what item gathering is like, if there's a line of people or anything.","time":1483528492000,"time4chanFormatted":"1/4/17(Wed)6:14","id":"dWMck3x2","name":"Anonymous","subject":null,"trip":null}
