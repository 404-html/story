They could be easier than we think, or they could be harder. I still don't think it necessitates spending EXP on it, when we know very little of how they actually work. <s>Being able to machinegun the spears would be baller as fuck though.</s><br><br><a href=\"#p37896009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;37896009</a><br>Saber doesn't offer us any form of abilities, though. Iirc, it was stated that it was, essentially, a more specialized form of Weapon Mastery, which is simply a damage/accuracy buff."}
