You duck low, and a swinging chain passes through the space your neck occupied mere moments prior. Rings of red light spiral out from beneath you as you trigger Haste—movement accelerating beyond natural capacity—and swing your weapon low at the exile’s ankles, cutting deep into one emaciated leg to hamper the creature’s movement.<br><br>Over the rocks, you can see more in the distance—the furthest might not have noticed the ongoing fight, but you think you get the gist of it; they’re fighting to overwhelm players who aren’t prepared for such a battle. You can see, in fact, how this might become exhausting.
