I still think economic power is the way to do so since the alliance will always have the combat advantage, lore advantage, and the advantage of pure numbers. We can counterbalance that with the economic, trade, and items we would have access to with an industrial/commercial guild. I'm not saying we should oppose the alliance but concentration of power is always worse than checks and balances."}
