Also gives us access to neat trump cards and elemental magic stuff like the ice-wand that killed the dragon which would be very handy.<br><br>On the other hand, as far as really being an artificer goes we'd always be second rate for having multiclassed into it. So all the gear and etc. we could make would follow in that. I would be very interested to see how it would pair with Kjorikos though. If it unlocks some sort of OP Lesser Art or something (it definitely could) then that alone might make it worth it.<br><br>On the other hand the Explorer's movement bonuses supplement our combat style incredibly well. We charge in the front all the time, so we might as well do so and make maps while we're at it, and be better at getting around and dodging our enemies. I think it would overall considerably upgrade our combat effectiveness.<br><br>Also explorer would let us gather our own materials more effectively, which would let us gear up in similar fashion to how artificer would...except we'd be able to get actually good artificers to make stuff with cheap mats we got ourselves (wouldn't need to splitsy with anyone either, because we're plenty combat savvy to guard ourselves).<br><br>Overall I'd lean towards Explorer. Persuade Nel to take Artificer as his secondary when he hits that point and we'd make one hell of a team."}
