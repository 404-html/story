I turned out to be pretty tired after all and am currently not feeling super well - but expect another thread (probably on an upcoming weekday evening, but maybe sooner depending on how I feel) where Ascheritte and party will hopefully begin the battle to the Seam.<br><br>I'll be around for a while to answer questions, probably on a different device, and will probably get back in the habit of using the Ask page. The mandatory board shift is kind of a pain - certainly fucked up my plan a little bit - but it'll hopefully be a good thing in the long run if it doesn't kill Quests altogether. Regardless, I'm better than up and dying because of something like that, certainly better than starting drama over it, and I'm sorry I forgot that for such a long time.<br><br>Sorry about the slow turnarounds today, too - long dialogue sequences have always taken me for-fucking-ever to write, distractions (which are currently very frequent in my life and will be for the foreseeable future) notwithstanding: this thread happened to have a lot of those. Regardless, thanks to everyone for showing back up and sticking around; you guys are puttin' in the real work.<br><br>Oh, yeah. If you like fan stuff, the Titanpad is still around for discussion and theorycraft, and I comment pretty frequently:<br>https://titanpad.com/kZOMVYSrMv[/spoiler]","time":1473575978000,"time4chanFormatted":"9/11/16(Sun)2:39","id":"aJoTo80m","name":"BSO","subject":null,"trip":"!3c0YaXQPuY","filename":"Pandora.jpg","fileSize":"75546 B","fileSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/images/1473575978858.jpg","fileThumbSrc":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/550943/thumbs/1473575978858s.jpg","md5":"8NSa2o6mpelyl+1IgW1oIw==","w":"432","h":"552","tn_w":"97","tn_h":"125"}
